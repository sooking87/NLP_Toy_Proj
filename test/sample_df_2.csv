[Verse 1]
It's to my real ill niggas, heavyweight hitters
Dough-getters, fifty ways to make figures
My niggas that come on the spot to feel sisters
Like they hear real spitters and kids on the zigga-ziggas
When it's ugly, then the club is lovely
Thugs be sippin' Hennessey and bubbly
To my comrades that keep it flamin' hot
On dangerous blocks, claimin' spots
Where the goal is to be one of the top-ranked soldiers
Forty-five holders, one of the high rollers
Get respect in the hood, credit is good
Knock it down lumberjack style, baby; extra wood
Rock it all night long, the bang-a-thon, baby
Keep hangin' on, we like it with the lights on
Don't have to blow twenty thou' to get to know honey's style
Show her the town, steal her heart, no money down

[Verse 2]
How about some hardcore? Yeah, we like it raw for sure
Broads on the floor, wall to wall
There's more at the door, players ball to score
‘Cause this right here is for all of y'all
Rakim and Premo; yo, I got what you need, bro
You go see a show, smokin' El Niño
And DJ's play hits with hard bass kicks
And then they display tricks like The Matrix
Make the record fly, undetected by the naked eye
So just feel the vibe, ‘cause your ears never lie
Nowadays DJ's bags of tricks, graphic
On some behind-the-back shit, catch it and scratch it
Blast it, this kid got his craft mastered
Hands is mad quick like he mix with magic
Spin it back and forth and grab it
And know just where it is… there it is

[Verse 3]
To my elite peeps with the murderous mystiques
I hit the streets with beats and they critique for weeks
They be like: ""How that kid Ra reach the peak?""
Pull out the heat and use my technique to speak
It's dangerous, sit calm and explain to kids
What part of the game this is in foreign languages
They hold Ra's events in different continents
Put my lyrical contents in monuments
In ghetto garments, I rock a towel like a pharaoh
Mind travel, design style like apparel
My fashions last long as a lifetime
‘Cause I can see the future when the god write rhymes
They're mad ‘cause I managed to reign so long
Like their chance to get money done came and gone
This is strictly for my listeners on the corners at night
And the sisters that be keepin' us right, when I be on the mic

It must be the way that I spit shit
That make you say, ""Damn, this nigga's ridiculous""
The way I hit 'em and move, nigga that can't lose
Inconspicuous, incognito, niggas ain't ready
For the ever so heavy flow, niggas know I spit deadly
Fear me to the day I'm dead on the streets
With holes in me, the ghetto's got love for me
'Cause I'ma lay for 'em if I have to, gradually there after
The only fib be love and disaster
Tears before laughter, but who gon' cry?
My style be so touchin' it could wipe your eye
Bring truth to obvious lies and dead wise guys
And any bitch niggas feel they fuckin with mines
C'mon, let's get it on 'til the break in the dawn
Before long, if you wrong, you'll be dead and gone
And I live on to glorify my name in vain
What you thought, motherfuckers, I was playin'? Baby, I kill 'em all

Lord, I won't be denied, I'ma hit 'em, hit 'em

Baby, I kill 'em all, what you wanna do with this, nigga?
Nothin', so shut the fuck up and learn somethin'
See, my team can get a whole town gamin', then be up
We even take your small change, nigga, give it up
You think my way of life's fucked up, right?
'Til you live it and that cash gets to eatin' at your spirit
Fear it, you be a broke nigga, get near it, you'll be the next nigga
Never have to go back, you been there
Cold stares won't make you a a killer around here
Y'all niggas really got some pitiful ideas
I keep tryin to get this world to see
Hustle hard, mind on that money, my motto be
Stack it if you got it for when you get it
Don't talk about it, just be about it, that it
With all odds against, niggas gettin' rich
Figured to earn a dollar makes sense, baby, I kill 'em all

Murderous style, comin' fresh out of Queens Isle (Brooklyn)
Recognize how my killer clique's gettin' down
For theirs while takin' yours in the process
Niggas is stressed, leavin' peep holes in your chest
God bless the next that get laid to rest
Frustration and stress make me question death
I wanna shoot all niggas I feel should be shot
On the spot, let 'em rot with lead in their knot
Talk shit, you bitch-ass niggas be lit
Smokin' weed to give you the heart to proceed
With your game plan, you the man, go for your guns
Feel no remorse when I leave your brain and runs, now
Settle down, get your shit tight
Show respect, move right and everything's alright
But if you slip, son, that ass is gone
Top Dog, motherfuckers, recognize, baby, I'ma kill 'em all

Look, I'm comin' straight off of Slauson
A crazy motherfucker named Nipsey
I'm turnt up cause I grew up in the 60s
Caution to you rap niggas try and diss me
I go hard that's why your bitch wanna flip me
Big guns, nigga, turn rivals into rosaries
Extended clips, I give a fuck who you 'posed to be
Straight off the block I sold dope to buy groceries
Now it's rap money, no advance, it's all royalties
You broke, nigga, you could follow me
It's fuck bitches, get money, keep some hollow heads logically
And I'm from where homicide boost the economy
Pay taxes to these corners and put in work, it's a policy (Hussle, Hussle)
It's white chalk on the corners
It's yellow tape on the gates
Choppers up above
That's 'cause the Tiny Locs runs the streets where I'm from
[Chorus]
This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns, money and bitches, that's the way that we do it
First get your grind on, then get your shine on
Then come through daytime with the lights on (Hussle, Hussle)
Now hit the fast lane and let your chain swang
You gettin' dollars like a doctor, but you gangbang
Yeah, it's Hussle in the house
Yeah, it's Hussle in the house (Hussle, Hussle)

[Verse 2]
Blue rag, S-hat, gold on my neck fat
Gun case, catch that, cuz, Neighborhood, I rep that
Shoot first, ask last, move work, fast cash
Brynhurst, 10th Ave, squabble if you get mad (Hussle, Hussle)
And in my lifetime, I seen a lot of death
A couple cold nights, it look like it was nothin' left
But God got me, so I got him tatted on my flesh
Slauson, nigga, you ain't heard shit yet
Cuzzy, Cobby, Hoodsta Rob, Tiny Draws
Infant Stone, when he come home, then baby, we dog
And can't forget my big brother Blacc Sam
Just a young hood nigga with a million dollar plan

This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns, money and bitches, that's the way that we do it
First get your grind on, then get your shine on

You gettin' dollars like a doctor, but you gangbang
Yeah, it's Hussle in the house
Yeah, it's Hussle in the house (Hussle, Hussle), look

I came from nothin', so did every other rapper
Save the speculation, real banger, gun clapper
Silence, hit the opposition with the MAC
I'll turn him into candles on the curb over blood splats
Fuck rest in peace shirts, nigga, where your guns at?
It done been two weeks and we ain't seen no get back
Type of shit is that? Your Crippin' is wack
You ain't poppin', you ain't turfed up, nigga, you off-deck
I promise, I'll be out lurking with the pump
Gooned up, black hoodie on, chopper in the trunk
Ready to hop out, and do my motherfuckin' stuff

Knocked up 9 months ago
And what she finna have? She don't know
She want neo-soul, this hip-hop is old
She don't want no Rock n' Roll
She want platinum or ice and gold
She want a whole lot of something to fold
If you a obstacle, she just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad, and these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told her ""Girl, look here, calm down, I'mma hold your hand
To enable you to peep the plan, cause you's quick to learn
We can make money to burn if you allow me to lay this game""
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread my wings
And the world finna know my name
[Verse 2:  Cody Chesnutt]
I don't ask for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow roots standing where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lover's back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine

[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock n' Roll""

Uh huh, Cadillac need space to roam
Where we heading for? She don't know
We in the city where the pros shake, rattle, and roll
And I'm a gad-dang rolling stone
I don't beg, I can hold my own
I don't break, I can hold the chrome
And it's weighing a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is The Only One
And Black Thought is bad, these streets he done ran
Ever since when the game began
I never played the fool, matter of fact, I been keeping it cool
Since money been changing hands, and I'm left to shine
The legacy that I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much, but enough room to spread these wings
And the world finna know my name, now listen to me

I don't beg from no rich man
And I don't scream and kick
When his shit don't fall in my hands, man
Cause I know how to steal
Fertilize another against my lover's will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Ooh, ooh, ooh no, dear
You'll be keeping my legend alive

[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drop my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock-n-roll""
Oh, break it down, break it down, down for me

[Hook 2: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cause I've taken my test
Deliver it Mary: it don't matter the sex
I'm gonna name it ""Rock-N-Roll""

Tick tock around the clock for the rock ya come see me
Just knock at the door I'll grant your wish like a genie
Strait out to get paid stack the loot that I made
Been slangin' dope out my mammas' house since the 10th grade
Never tried it can't deny it in the riots was a looter
Used to hang with drive by shooters
Stickem up for Honda scooters
Never was a scholar make you throw yo hands and holla
Wolla went to Jr. high slangin' joints fo a dollar
Finger waves was the new fad so they spoted a due rags
Niggas got dumped on fo the red or blue rags
Down with the G's so them niggas never serve me
Bellin' through the hood in my honeycomb Jersey
Painter pants cuffed so I fixit on my biscuits
Till my hair get long enough to brade my bitch I'll keep it twisted
It's that niggarunnin' wild punch the pedal to the meadow
And everywhere I go it's a must I keep it ghetto

Lyrics[Verse 1]
I gets banned if I do gets banned if I don't
So sometimes I will and sometimes I won't
Puff mad stick crack a forty down the back
Sit fat and relax and plan my attack
Not the one to test I possess mad finesse
My Buddha was blessed one bird in the nest
Chills with my peeps steady bouncing in Jeeps
On the New York streets hittin' urban concrete
I'm the man untestable, with the extra-
Terrestrial flow, Four Fifty Six Cee-Lo
Pop the top off the forty ounce bottle
I'm not the one to follow, I'm not the role model
Hollow tips in my clips money grip and my Glock
Only spits when I react to the bullshit
So give me room to breathe and get up off DEEZ
And save the confessions for JEESuz
Plus I don't need to hear no sorrow
Eff it, the sun will still come out tomorrow
Long as I'm breathing, needing, even like
Steven, achieving, gettin some cheese and
Representin' lovely, Boogie Down Bronx major
With the project flavor, I made ya
Daze ya, my behavior is mad ill if you front
You know what I want!

I'mma let you know how I feel on the real, I pack
Steel, it's like a jungle, makes me wonder where my heel hits the
Bricks, skips the dog shit, completin' my cipher
Temper like Rowdy Roddy Piper, hyper like a
Viper, I'mma strike if I gotta
Goin' for the jugular stretch you like a copper stoppah
Stoppah, but you can't stop me
Just clock me, just watch me blow up the spot G
Came a long way from back in the day
We did it for no pay, just rhymin' hit the hay and
Sleep, wake up, write another rhyme
Hit the park after dark, drop the beat one time
That's when shit was real, no phonies no bologna
Just a homie, mics and wheels of steel
Backup from the roof, amp plugged in the street light
Everything right, jam over: street fight
Back to the lab I grab my pen and pad
Raw lyrics make a sore and a scab
Had no dinero, enough get fo' chicken wings and rice
A forty ounce a nickel bag to get nice
And now I might make a million, and still son
It makes the heart pump, you know what I want

Be like Elmer J. Fudd with the mansion and the yacht
Brand new Glock non-stop hip-hop
Remote control boombox lampin' on my dresser
The God ain't no lesser as the pressure comes to test ya
Hundred pound weight around the neck, daily
Nuff treasons, nuff reasons like Philip Bailey
Can't get enough of that funky stuff
Rhymin' astronomical, original, shit is phenomenal
Heat up the ghetto put the pedal to the metal
Speed like Racer treat you like a wack rhyme and erase ya
Right off the paper, roll a big fat spliff
Four-fifth on the hip, Heineken in the grip shit
I'm ready, get the keys for the Jeep, let's bounce
Cruise avenues, get some brews and sing the blues with the
Funkmaster Flex cassette in the deck
I'm in effect I move my neck while Son gets wreck
Oh what a feeling, I'm on the wheels of steel and
I snatch up some skins for some sexual healing
Erything's kosher copacetic, groovy hip-hop moves me
Soothes me, I'm letting off like an Uzi
But first steps a doozy and bruise me
Now I'm choosy before I start to freak it like a floozy
I wanna get big get paid true stunt
You know what I want!

But oh wait, whoa y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm

R.I.P, R.I.P
R.I.P we just killed the club
Took Patrón to the head, almost killed a thug
[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Got a pocket full of dead prez
Attached to your girl like a .jpeg
Party scene turn to a murder scene
Keep shitting on niggas, need potty train
Turn up, collard green
I'm on gasoline and
I'm on that promethazine
Life ain't nothing but a G thing
Switch lanes, get brain, hand down her g-string
I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
You fuck with me, Ill put my foot in your ass
I got a million in stash, I stack my money so tall
That you might need a giraffe
When you was counting this cash, nigga!

[Hook]
R.I.P we just killed the club
Took Patrón to the head, almost killed a thug
I'm so high I can't feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here
I don't feel the love
R.I.P, R.I.P
R.I.P, R.I.P
R.I.P we just killed the club
Took Patrón to the head, almost killed a thug15Embed",0.193,0.762,0.046,-0.9984
