Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl (Girl)
[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby

Levitating,Dua Lipa Featuring DaBaby,2021-07-17,"Dua Lipa - Levitating feat. DaBaby (Türkçe Çeviri) Lyrics[Intro: DaBaby]
Billboard bebeğim, Dua Lipa gelirken onları dans ettir
Herkes koşacak bir dans pisti arıyor

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Eğer benimle kaçmak istiyorsan, bir galaksi biliyorum
Ve seni gezmeye götürebilirim
İçimde ritme kapılacağımıza dair bir his var
Müziğin ömür boyu durmadığı bir yerde
Parıltı gökyüzünde, parıltı gözlerimde
Tam istediğim gibi parlıyor
Eğer bir ortağa ihtiyacın olduğunu düşünüyorsan
Benimle mükemmel zamanda tanıştın
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Sen beni istiyorsun, ben seni istiyorum, bebeğim
Şekerim, havaya uçuyorum
Samanyolu, kaçıyoruz
Evet, evet, evet, evet, evet

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Yakladım seni, ay ışığı, sen benim yıldız ışığımsın
Bütün gece sana ihtiyacım var, hadi, benimle dans et
Havalara uçuyorum
Sen, ay ışığı, sen benim yıldız ışığımsın (Sen ay ışığısın)
Bütün gece sana ihtiyacım var, hadi, benimle dans et
Havalara uçuyorum

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Ben en iyilerindeyim, tartışılacak bir şey yok (Hadi)
Hala uçuyorum, ağır ilaç etkisindeyim
İronik, Ben onlara aşk veriyorum sonunda yine benden nefret ediyorlar (Git)
Kız bana söyledi beni seviyormuş ve beklemiş
Senin aşkın için çabalıyordum ve sabrım tükeniyor
Sarılacak birine ihtiyacım var, temele bile döndüm
Görüyor musun bana neler yaptırdığını (Evet)
Beni yerimden edebilirler, ama kimse bu eylemi durduramaz
Uh-uh, hadi
Sol ayak, sağ ayak, uçuyorum (Hadi)
Pop Yıldızları (Git), Dua Lipa ve DaBaby
Peşinde olduğum tüm nimetler için ayakkabılarımı bağlamak zorunda kaldım (Git)
Eğer düşersem, daha iyi bir durumda olurum
Yani yetiş, daha iyisin yap
Kalk ve parayı kovala (Evet, evet)
Hep terk ederler düştüğünde, ama beraber koşarsınız (Hey)
Dünyanın ağırlığı omuzlarımda, başımı dik tutuyorum
Şimdi, bebek, aya kalk, çünkü, kız, sen
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa & DaBaby]
Sen beni istiyorsun, ben seni istiyorum, bebeğim
Şekerim, havaya uçuyorum
Samanyolu, kaçıyoruz
Evet, evet, evet, evet, evet

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Yakladım seni, ay ışığı, sen benim yıldız ışığımsın
Bütün gece sana ihtiyacım var, hadi, benimle dans et
Havalara uçuyorum
Sen, ay ışığı, sen benim yıldız ışığımsın (Sen ay ışığısın)
Bütün gece sana ihtiyacım var, hadi, benimle dans et
Havalara uçuyorum

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Bu gece benimle uzaklara uçabilirsin
Bu gece benimle uzaklara uçabilirsin
Bebeğim, bırak seni gezmeye götüreyim
Evet, evet, evet, evet, evet
Havalara uçuyorum (Woo)
Bu gece benimle uzaklara uçabilirsin
Bu gece benimle uzaklara uçabilirsin
Bebeğim, bırak seni gezmeye götüreyim

Aşkım bir roket gibi, fırlamasını izle
Ve çok heyecan verici hissediyorum, dibine kadar dans ediyorum
Ve istesem bile durduramam

Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't

Save Your Tears,The Weeknd & Ariana Grande,2021-07-17,"Save Your Tears (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: The Weeknd & Ariana Grande]
Ooh (Ooh)
Na-na, yeah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

[Refrain: The Weeknd & Ariana Grande]
I don't know why I run away (Oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Ariana Grande]
Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Mm)

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
I don't know why I run away, oh boy (Run away, oh yeah; oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Away, oh; oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Oh)
[Refrain: Both, Ariana Grande]
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't know why I run away (Oh)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I make you cry when I run away (Save)

[Chorus: Both, Ariana Grande & The Weeknd]
Save your tears for another day (Ooh; oh)
Ooh, girl, I said (Okay)
Save (Save) your (Your) tears for another day (Oh yeah, yeah; oh)

[Outro: The Weeknd & Both]

Deja Vu,Olivia Rodrigo,2021-07-17,"​deja vu Lyrics[Verse 1]
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
[Bridge]
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

I know you get déjà vu

Astronaut In The Ocean,Masked Wolf,2021-07-17,"Astronaut in the Ocean Lyrics[Intro]
Astronaut

[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean
[Verse 1]
She say that I'm cool (Damn straight)
I'm like, ""Yeah, that's true"" (That's true)
I believe in G-O-D (Ayy)
Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb (Play me)
I'ma play her for fun (Uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)

[Bridge]
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (Uh, get it)
Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)
[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy

Rapstar,Polo G,2021-07-17,"RAPSTAR Lyrics[Intro]
(Shout out my nigga Synco)

[Chorus]
Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished
[Verse 1]
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—

[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished
[Verse 2]
They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought

[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Am I the only one, here tonight
Shakin' my head and thinkin' somethin' ain't right
Is it just me? Am I losin' my mind?
Am I standin' on the edge of the end of time?

[Verse 2]
Am I the only one? Tell me I'm not
Who thinks they're takin' all the good we got
And turnin' it bad, hell, I'll be damned
I think I'm turnin' into my old man
[Chorus]
Am I the only one, willin' to bleed
Or take a bullet for bein' free
Screamin', ""What the fuck!"" at my TV
For tellin' me, yeah, are you tellin' me?
That I'm the only one, willin' to fight
For my love of the red and white
And the blue, burnin' on the ground
Another statue comin' down in a town near you

[Post Chorus]
Watchin' the threads of Old Glory come undone

[Verse 3]
Am I the only one not brainwashed?
Makin' my way through the land of the lost
Who still gives a shit, and worries 'bout his kids
As they try to undo all the things he did?

[Chorus]
Am I the only one who can't take no more
Screamin', ""If you don't like it there's the fuckin' door""
This ain't the freedom we've been fightin' for
It was somethin' more, yeah, it was somethin' more
Am I the only one, willin' to fight
For my love of the red and white
And the blue, burnin' on the ground
Another statue comin' down in a town near you
[Post Chorus]
Watchin' the threads of Old Glory come undone
I'm not the only one
I can't be the only one

[Bridge]
Am I the only one who quit singin' along
Every time they play a Springsteen song

[Chorus]
Am I the only one sittin' here
Still holdin' on, holdin' back my tears
For the ones who paid with the lives they gave
God bless the U.S.A
I'm not the only one, willin' to fight
For my love of the red and white
And the blue, burnin' on the ground
Another statue comin' down in a town near you

Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

[Verse 1]
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Post me a pic, finna make me a profit
When the liquor hit, then a bitch get toxic
(Why the fuck you in the club when niggas wildin’?)
I've been lit since brunch, thot shit
Order '42 for the table, let’s pop shit
Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her (Ah)
[Chorus]
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin’ ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, ha-hands on my knees
Hands on my knees, shakin’ ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin’ ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, hands on my knees

[Verse 2]
Hoes said they wish a bitch would, and I'm a genie
Bitch so hot, gotta stay in bikinis
He got a girl, but he keep beggin' to see me
I love it when a nigga got a mouth full of VVs
No, I'm not a patient, but I let him treat me
I gotta be a doctor how I’m orderin' CCs
Go to your place, no face, no case
Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually
Are they supportin' you or really just attackin' me?
I don't give a fuck 'bout a blog tryna bash me
I'm the shit per the Recording Academy (Ah)
[Chorus]
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)

Drinkin' out the motherfuckin' bottle on my thot shit
Everything I eat go straight to my pockets
2021, finna graduate college
Goth girl shit, I'm a real hot topic
Fuckin' on a nigga, make him sing, on some pop shit
I need a real headbanger, on some rock shit
Pussy like crack, wanna hit it like dope
Got a real hot box, but a bitch don't smoke (Ah)
Hot girl, but I'm still the coldest, hey
I'm the big homie, but I ain't the oldest, hmm
Bitch dry hatin', tryna get noticed
Man, ain't nobody come to see you, Otis, look
How many bitches lyin' if they say they bars is better?
They really puppets, so I really gotta go and Geppetto
I'm really talkin', but it really can apply to whoever
My pen a freak, it'll go after a bitch or a nigga (Huh)
Big bank take lil' bank, bitch, add it up
Hoes takin' shots, but they ain't in my caliber
Booked, but I squeeze a lil' head in my calendar
Lookin' in the mirror like, ""Damn, I don't brag enough""
LVs, double C's, Birkins, I'm workin'
My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain
None of these hoes sayin' shit to my face
And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want
And I dare one of these hoes come tell me I can't
We ain't even speakin' if the nigga ain't spendin'
He could never say that I was one of his women
I don't even let niggas know where I stay
I'll be damned if he thinkin' he poppin' up on this pimpin' (Ah)

A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

[Pre-Chorus]
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Verse 2]
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
