steps ahead,trains,1986,"#DareToZlatan LyricsHi @Twitter. For tomorrow Zlatan needs more than 140 characters. Please change rules for Zlatan #DareToZlatan

Need help to ZLATAN? Learn to take the risks that make legends. Ask questions. Learn the ways. #DareToZlatan

Dear @EdgleyLFC. Daring to Zlatan is easy. Start by trying moves that can’t be done. Keep trying until you are Zlatan. #DareToZlatan
Incorporate Zlatan’s teachings into your life, @life_of_eisen, and one day @NikeFootball might make a t-shirt named after you. #DareToZlatan

Zlatan applauds the number of times you got Zlatan into one sentence, @jflint91. Always do what others don't have guts to try. #DareToZlatan

There are 2 things Zlatan cannot do @at_sunshine. One is be predictable. The other is a step-under. But Zlatan is practising. #DareToZlatan
Am I mad @bailofwz? Would a sane man try a 32 yard overhead kick in an international match? #DareToZlatan
To Zlatan like Zlatan, practice with pressure. As the heat rises, so will your game. #DareToZlatan http://youtu.be/29Po75THraU

Hey, @Areeb23. Learn to unlearn the word ‘safe’. Because if you don’t know what it means you can’t play it. #DareToZlatan

Dear @ArmouredGuy, a wise man once said, surprising your opponent is the key to surprising them. That wise man was Zlatan. #DareToZlatan

@EurosportCom_FR Let’s work together. Zlatan scores the goals, Eurosport writes them up. Deal? #DareToZlatan
Hi @Greg_douglass, failure is the first step to success. The second step is growing a ponytail. #DaretoZlatan

@MillarHarry Because two Zlatans would just be unfair. #DareToZlatan

@AAlasfoor10 Zlatan’s favourite stadium is the one with grass and two goals. Every stadium is a potential stage. #DareToZlatan

Set-piece perfection shows true inner peace. Use this to train your pressure muscles. #DareToZlatan

When the heat becomes unbearable, there’s only one thing to do. Make it hotter.#DareToZlatan

When it comes to dealing with pressure follow this tip. #DareToZlatan

To Zlatan is to embrace your fears and take the risks necessary to overcome them. #DareToZlatan http://youtu.be/7SBnk3lKzzg

Dear @AmirunSalleh, nothing Zlatan does is easy. That's why Zlatan does it. #DareToZlatan
Hi @rumadbro00 self-belief leads to self-confidence. Self-confidence leads to self-belief which leads to self-confidence again #DareToZlatan

@AlotibeH Zlatan admires your daring. The only goalkeeper in the world who hopes to play against Zlatan. #DareToZlatan

Dear @Khaledsaifi. Zlatan used this simple thought process. #DareToZlatan

@KHow20 @CRiegg18 Weaker feet are there to be weak so you always have something to improve. Take the shot. #DareToZlatan

Fear to Zlatan is like gas to a turbo charged sports car. The more you put in the further you go. #DareToZlatan

Hey @citralistyarini. You'll never score a diving header if you keep your feet on the ground. #DareToZlatan

Need to impress a scout? Take risks to score great goals. If that doesn't work, try this. #DareToZlatan

@101greatgoals #DareToZlatan: dare to miss in order to score. Risk to lose in order to win. If in doubt use this.

Take risks and surprise your opponents. Once you've done that, send them one of these. #DareToZlatan

Yes @Tom_J_Webster. Zlatan is just a human. The same way a great white shark is just a fish. #DareToZlatan

@delce_1004 Zlatan’s best goal is always his next. #DaretoZlatan

@Eymen144 Some players train to be one step ahead of the game. Zlatan trains to be two steps ahead of the world. #DareToZlatan

@JesperBulykin Fear for breakfast, defenders for lunch, and pickled herring for dinner. #DareToZlatan
@itsLeRoy_ You have passed stage one of #DareToZlatan. Next step, a 34 yard shot. With your other foot.

To Zlatan you must trust your instincts, think one step ahead. Only then will risk become reflex. #DareToZlatan http://youtu.be/Nxm6Y_v7_SA

@NathanBKShanko It does when Zlatan uses it as a blindfold. #DareToZlatan http://giphy.com/gifs/44BwAV2lhCqRGFcnKKY?tc=1

@JordanWilsonn7 The only thing Zlatan can’t do is play it safe in the face of danger. #DareToZlatan http://giphy.com/gifs/pg9suKHtCDql3RUi5i?tc=1

@ibbyAbd8 It was skill that Zlatan scored it. Luck that Zlatan is Swedish. #DareToZlatan

@HazardIsLife With belief. You may have to wait til the last minute for your first chance. But when it comes #DaretoZlatan, like Zlatan.

@niallmcg86 Zlatan does score tap ins. From 33 yards. With his heel. #DareToZlatan

@christiaaannzz Pressure makes adrenalin. Adrenalin makes performance. Performance makes Zlatan. Zlatan makes grown men cry. #DaretoZlatan

@MattCrivelli ‘Worst’ isn’t in Zlatan’s vocabulary. Although ‘goal’ is frequently used. #DareToZlatan

@AyyeitsArv Trust your instincts. Learn to see a bicycle kick as nothing more than an upside-down volley. #DareToZlatan

@koerazak You don’t need Zlatan to teach you. When you believe in yourself, Zlatan is there. #DareToZlatan

Today’s been good. Continue as Zlatan has taught you. If ever in doubt. Use this. #DareToZlatan5Embed",0.091,0.739,0.17,0.9972
horace andy,don't let problems get you down,1996,"Diggin’ in the Crates Lyrics[Intro: Diamond D]
And you don't stop, a-keep on
And you don't stop, a-keep on
And you don't stop, a-keep on
And you don't stop, a-keep on
And you don't stop, a-keep on
And you don't stop, a-keep on
And you don't stop, a-keep on

[Verse 1: Diamond D]
Yo, praise the Lord for Showbiz
My partner with the beats with the Nikes on his feet
Buying old records is a habit
I get more run than a Volkswagen Rabbit
You know I gotta have it
I got more props than the cop called McGarrett
Who played on Hawaii Five-O
When I formed a production company with Show
And Jay's studio is the lab (The lab)
But the session is closed 'cause I know you got a big nose
Tried to sniff out the name
You lack originality and that's a damn shame
Don't front, I know I got you open
Like a pack of tokens, yo, I pulled your coat and
I'm not the one to be gamed on
I didn't know it was your girl we ran the train on
But no hard feelings, your girl was appealing
Did my share of dealing, sexual healing
You didn't know she was a groupie
But I'm a put you up on a scoop, B
Used to live in Forrest, my daughter lives on Morris
Used to play softball with my man Horace
I kick flavor like my man Sonny Chiba
Aries is my sign, I'm compatible with Libra
I like to program beats
Diamond D is out, I wanna say peace
Showbiz, there's deals to make
So let's get busy and dig in the crates
[Verse 2: Showbiz]
Yo, thank Allah for Diamond D
No afro, instead he keeps dreads in his head
My partner from the past, from 163rd
Back when I was a hoodlum beating on nerds
It started way back (Way back when?)
About twelve years ago, I was nine, he was ten
Before smoking weed or hanging out or playing hooky
We used to breakdance and the jam's ""Electric Boogie""
Girls watched, jocking, my nickname was Rock and
The crowd I was shocking, freaks I was clocking
Step up and see Showbiz performin'
My beats hit hard like big George Foreman
So MC's and DJ's who thought they was nice and
Get upset like Buster did to Tyson
That wasn't the plan and he's still my man
Since he beat up Mitch Green outside Dapper Dan
Wait a minute, that's a different subject
Talk about the Moet and the papers that's in effect
Back to the Show, the Show-B-I-Z
Down with D.I.T.C., A.G. is my MC
Relying on the Giant, the Giant I'm relying
Never crying for the crack 'cause I'm not a crack client
Girls stick like Krazy Glue, they think they're getting dough
But I treat hoes like drugs, I just say no
I lamp in the residence, I'm keeping dead presidents
In fact, I like my pockets fat, not flat
A rapper, not a singer, so hooker don't bring a
Problem to me, so go ahead, you humdinger
Show's about to blow in '91, so I'm straight
Down with the crew called Diggin' in the Crates
[Verse 3: A.G.]
So get back, get your sticks and get your bats
Get your licks and I'ma still get fat
Try to diss and get the backhand
I'm dressed in black, a black hat for a Black man
The Giant is better and clever
Go ahead and sleep and you'll rest forever and ever
I'm like a bomb, sometimes I'm calm
No telling what can happen once the mic is in my right palm
Me and Showbiz two-deep, but don't sleep
Go ahead and retreat or face agony of defeat
A.G. is in command
You'll remember the black hat and the bottom of my Timberlands
Save it, if you think you pose a threat
Just chill and watch how many hoes I get
Now you sweat the props I got
(Kick a rhyme) A rhyme? Sure, why not?
Always get fat to a hype track
So Finesse (What's up?), psych, gimme that mic back
The crowd I'll capture, microphone master
Finger licking and kicking lyrics from here to Africa
I'm the bold kind, my rhyme's a gold mine
Let it off, set it off, just for old times
Think you're ready for this, you wanna battle?
Your music is riddle-raddle, your rhymes are scribble-scrabble
The Giant is greater, so I'm great
Down with the group called Diggin' in the Crates
[Interlude: Lord Finesse]
Yeah, yeah, we gon' set it off like this

[Verse 4: Lord Finesse]
Now when it comes to lyrics, mics I pulverize
It's Lord Finesse, time to go for mine
So stand back, let the men play
I put rhymes in shape just like Bengay
I'm great and honorable, suckers I bomb a few
I run more games than a carnival
I'ma get mine as soon as you say start
Sweat hoods and funky rhymes is my trademark
I'ma get fame, not from her or his name
'Cause yo, (What's up?), I'm funkier than a shit stain
Mics I smoke, rhymes I hurl
My hobby is collecting fly-looking girls
Strictly for the ladies, call me Lord Finesse
And I'm all about money and sex
Finesse is the name to say and I came to play
We could have fun, but put the whips and chains away
Sex and money's what makes me a happy man
And I sport more styles than Jackie Chan
I keep rising, I'm not the type to sink low
Me take a loss on the mic? I don't think so
Lord Finesse is out to make papes

Me and Grimeyy took the city, now these fuck niggas mad
On my mama
Only Murdaa, nigga

[Verse: 30 Deep Grimmeyy]
Free Lil DJ from your section, cuz know you a bitch
Smokin' on D, clutching my XD while I cruise through the strip
Somebody get that nigga crutches, he ain't standing on shit
He called Apple, Freaky declined while she was sucking his dick
Lil D tried creeping through that crib, they shot his ass through the door
He say he smoking on my brother, DP roll up that Noah
Bitch, I got Tyga in my swisher, this shit fresh out the morgue
He claim he beefed with 30 Deep, bitch, when the fuck did y'all score?
Streets caught him lacking on that West, lil' blood put on his cleats
Pistol scraped him in that jerk and damn near knocked out his teeth
Been with the shits since Lil Revolver, just ask Stillwell Reece
Y'all niggas known for binkin' cars, quit all that cappin' 'bout Dee
Clutching my XD while I ride, can't let them do me like Zoe
Slide through they set, they ain't outside, they don't even post at they store
Caught 'em at The Lux, niggas tail tuck, I swear we beefing with hoes
They said they caught me in the lawn, well, why the fuck y'all ain't blow?
Keezy BM ran through the gang, shit, she real a deal demon
I heard you gave your daughter lean, blood, what the fuck you was thinking?
D West caught him with his bitch, he was like, ""Nah, I ain't mean it""
Flip through the line like couple lines and have your whole team ringing
Them niggas telling on each other, tell 'em free Lil Tyrell
Throw him a homecoming party filled with demons and shells
Lil D and D West, JB beat 'em, heard he keep taking L's
Bay-Bay 30s hit my line like, ""Send a shank in the mail""
Couldn't get jiggy, niggas bitches, so they clique with the 50
30Deep, bitch, that's the gang, we only clique up with semis
She told me pull up, then she blocked me, think the ho tried to spin me
Had to put up that lil' Bharger for that new ball Infiniti
JB lawyer say he can't smoke, but he been blowin' Poo-Wop
Them niggas hoes, ain't get outside until Lil Tana got knocked
Thought it was ""Never leave my brothers,"" that's how Lil Tyga got rocked
Lil Chris a rat, slid down Ferris and tried to score and got blocked
Bitch, I been thumbing through these hundreds, smoking on this K-Money
Just ask Lil Tay-Tay how them hands work with my lil' bro Money
Coco a ho, that nigga enrolled, then he stopped coming to Sumner
Niggas cappin' on the gang, tell me how they clapped at your mama
Let's get on Floyd, we used to clique until they linked with the Strip
Heard Pressure Gang been pressin' niggas like JB with that stick
Them niggas told on my lil' cousin, fuck it, let that bitch rip
Do his ass like Mexico or Lil' KO from the six
He say he smokin' on my brother, Murdaa, roll up that Borey
The only time he shooting shit is with Vick and with Toreyy
At first, I wasn't gon' do this shit, but niggas keep tellin' stories
Tell the city you ain't run and put that shit on Lil' Borey
Bitch, I'm Grimeyy, extra slimy, 29 be behind me
You ain't in that 29, better go hide in the county
Send your blood brother ten, bitch, I don't need no lil' bounty
Pistole just bought some more pistols 'cause that Draco kept bouncin'
Free my 30's out they jam, they took they hot and they cot
They ain't booked for killin' tweaks and no lil' thumper or box
They come and get me, I'ma do my time, bitch, and grow me some locks
And crazy E do drills for free, don't make him creep through your lot
You gon' think you love that bitch until you see that four-five
Them set-up hoes in your section do that shit for four thou'
DP blood steady spinnin' blocks, he jammin' out the Zoe Pound
So much temptation, David Ruffin, bitch, I'm runnin' Motown
Gon' have your gang at your service dressed up like the Heartbeats
That nigga seen us, started shakin', think I heard his heartbeat
And they keep pushin' Money date back 'cause he keep scrapin' beef
They tell they hoes turn that shit off when they play 30 Deep
Until we find 'em, we gon' keep passin' 'round this Lil Twan
Murdaa anxious with that glizzy, I be takin' my time
Last goofy nigga lived, so I don't play with them nines
Bitch, you gon' think he got your front until that knife in your spine
I got niggas on your side of town
Send them ten, bet them killers come and gun you down
Tell your neighbors stay put up, bitch, we got hundred rounds
Grab some goggles, grab some vests, or you gon' fuckin' drown

But I'll never forget the way you feel right now

And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you

As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You better believe it

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

[Verse 2]
And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it
[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No no no, I won't do that

[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do

[Verse 3]
But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Call (and Response)]
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
(I can do that
Oh, I can do that)
Will you hold me sacred
Will you hold me tight
Will you colorize my life
I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?
(I can do that
Oh no now, I can do that)
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?
(Now, I can do that
Ooh now, I can do that)
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
(Now, I can do that
Oh now, I can do that)
After a while you'll forget everything
As a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
Then you'll see that it's time to move on
(I won't do that
I won't do that)
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later, you'll be screwing around
(I won't do that
No, I won't do that)

enrique iglesias,si t? te vas,1995,"Rafale de Punchlines Lyrics[Intro]
Ouais
On viens tout droit du Val-de-Marne
La plume aiguisé
Le propos est puissant et je grave des zes-bla sur une plaque de marbre
Tu reconnais le style du clan?
La Hyène du Bois-l'Abbé mon grand
J'envoie des rafales de punchlines dans leurs mères et je vois la concurrence qui pisse du sang
Rafales de punchlines, hey ouais
La rue la vrai, la Hyène 9.4, Sinco, B.L.A gang
Tu veux d'la punch frérot ?
Vas-y monte j'vais te vi-ser
Han
[Couplet unique : LA Hyène]
Salam aleykoum les khos, je suis de retour dans le game pour les éduquer
J'arrive de Champigny-sur-Marne, comme le le RER A dégagé du quai
En featuring la vérité, le franc parlé dont j'ai hérité, pendant que les salopes du rap game se mettent a danser comme Iglesias Enrique
J'suis calibré de savoir et mes bastos rafale ton bide
J'suis validé par la street gros, pas par la série de Gastambide
J'fais rimer la violence noire et morbide
Les pieds sur terre, le cerveau en orbite
J'suis comme Paris j'ai les meilleurs supporters
J'encule la ligue 1 du rap tranquille
La rue m'a façonné alors j'la chante comme un passionné
J'avoue qu'on a mené des guerres d'imbéciles pour voir nos quartiers ovationné
La confiance est un cadeau qui coûte cher Il vaut mieux savoir la rationner
Si ta pétasse est bonne mais consomme plus qu'un bolide, elle restera pas longtemps stationner
Le mépris est total pour les gosses de banlieues défavorisés
Mais parfois les bourgeois y trouvent leurs intérêts, donc nos vies misérables sont scénarisé
Pas besoin de perdre du fric dans les paris pour que mes défaites soit analysés
Si l'argent n'a pas d'odeur la hass pue la merde, et l'haleine des condés l'alcool anisé
Quand je passe à table c'est pour graille et pas pour dénoncer mes khos
Je choisi ma prod comme de la de-vian bien saignante pour le plaisir d'y planter mes crocs
Personne ne choisit les membres de sa famille, comme personne ne choisit ses défauts
Dès la naissance la mort te regarde de travers, on a tous signé un contrat chez Death Row
Tu peux te croire à L.A dans ma ville quand le soleil est au Zénith
Respecte les règles ou tu finit plein de sang dans une belle-pou comme une serviette hygiénique
On peut dénoncer ce qui se passe en Palestine sans pour autant être antisémite
Comme tu peux ne pas rouler en Renault dans ta vie, sans pour autant être anti Scenic
Je t'envoie des punchs assassine qui peuvent m'emmener aux assises, pour avoir violé les putes du rap game ou l'incitation a tirer sur l'insigne
La rue c'est un banquier qu'il n'accorde pas crédit comptant, la réussite s'achète
Je veux faire du bif en liquide pour en finir avec l'échec (les chèques)
Je pourrai accélérer comme dans V12 mais j'ai trop la flemme
Je préfère dédicacer mes khos, mes soldats, et tous les détenus en taule a Fresnes
Nos cœurs sont taillés dans des blocs de granit, donc c'est du solide lorsque l'on s'aime
Nos cœurs sont taillés dans des blocs de granit, donc on se lapide quand il y a de la haine
On va brutaliser le rap game comme d'habitude
Mes opinions sont encré dans ma tête
Sont qué-blo comme l'épée d'escalibur
Tu peux me croiser marchant seul le crâne rasé, parce qu'on ne rase pas les murs
Chez nous les mots et les actes se font la paire tout ça parce qu'on a des burnes
C'est la pénurie du bien, le mal fait des ravages
Je regarde le monde se cannibaliser
Les dealers flippent que le cannabis soit légalisé
Je connais des familles qui vivent de la marijuana, comme dans les rues de Tijuana, voiture gé-char comme la kalash
Prêt à faire feu sur les agents des Douanes
Me viens pas parler d'amour ici tout le monde s'en bas les yeuc
Les seules geste affectif que la rue connaît c'est le bon vieux coup de tête, balayette
Une balle direct ta pierre tombale est dressés, ton nom écrit comme au Starbuck
La vie coûte cher, mais la mort l'a dépecer
Moto casqué comme les Daft Punk
Génie en herbe de la rue part en fumé comme la skunk
L'ancien du tier-quar rempli de principe
Les valeurs à disparus comme la funk
Je reviens du futur pour sauver le pe-ra mais sans la coupe de zemel a la Trunk
Les fils de pute je les met tous dans le même panier
J'attrape la concu et j'la Dunk

[Outro]
Rafale de punch
Ouais petit j'envoie des rafales de punchs
Le game est niquer, je suis là pour les plier
Je suis sans pitié comme ses bâtards de keuf
J'tire dans le tas pour leurs per-ta le rrain-té

Let me tell you something my friend
Hope is a dangerous thing
Hope can drive a man insane
Its got no use on the other side
You better get used to that idea

[Intro: Sol Virani & (Method Man)]
I got cotton mouth
You know how it go
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
[Verse 1: Sol Virani]
Look
I wonder if I fail just how many will go to hell
I'm trying to send good messages, fuck how many I sell
Hoping my assumptions of theory is just a fail
Hoping that my lessons of goodness riches prevail
Not saying I'm perfect, say I'm harder than that
But I got standard from when niggas rocked a starter cap
And I got morals for myself, I'm living by a code
And I arrive for you even if you hardly drove
Figure that, my intuition be gone on expeditions
I suffer from crazy visions but I don't need a psych camp
See Einstein and Newton and all the greatest minds
We ever had in time were crazy too
I turn on my lamp
Enlighten you even if you're frightened to
I'll sensei that ass you can get to riping dude
And help you find the right path like a big Nissan
Pull you in the right direction, you ain't got a leash on
Searching for the wealth homie, I'm trying to get my feast on
Trying to get some ladies on my Johnson like Keshawn
Boy just put the beat on and I'll float away
But I ain't flowing with the current yah I flow astray
I'm swimming in a new direction this you won't predict
Its like I'm dropping out, can't fuck with this school of fish
Cause if I take the current then I'm just like everybody else
And niggas is so similar they can't think for themselves
Oh no

Let's take them back
Check the old school flow
Like water see I sorta got a Rick James aura
Let the whole school know the order
Yeah
Can't tell you what an old fool know
But anything organic, that's a whole food store
Taking nothing for granted
If you hoes too slow too bad
When one door open they close two more
I ball and dragon y'all
That Goku glow
Stash grams in ceiling fans
I don't do blow or pills
My 40 below's giving them chills
I can drive a hard bargain
And never give them the wheel
That's ill, Park Hill
Never ran, never will
Listen king
I jack queen if you don't tell her the deal
Black or white

This is dog 101, now give Cruella the steel, blaw

I grew impatient and no longer could be vacant
See I hoard thoughts, in a gold box
Lay it down like I'm her patient
Got a pill like I'm the one
Guess that puts me in The Matrix
See I'm the boss so I just call you up for cancellation
I'm aching
For sweet love and back breaking
That's what I tell the universe when we communicating
So when we have a baby that's the time for celebration
And roll the trees up, take me on a vacation
Picture me just standing on the corner of Magnolia
Strolling though the projects with my niggas man I told ya
And you ain't standing next to me either
Cause they'll hold ya up
Hit you with the rope-a-dope
And have you feeling like a duck
Straight plucked
Fucking with me you straight fucked
Just lube up if you want to play it tough boy
Them armor piercing rounds will wet your ass up boy
But like a transvestite I keep my shit tucked boy

Ca s'fight comme Budokai, des schlags s'butent aux cailloux
A part ca c'est plutôt calme, mais garde tes distances juste au cas où..
Athmoshère chaotique comme une scène de Tarantino
Sauf que c'est pas garanti qu'à 40 piges on s'ra en vie nous !

Mais rien lire sur mes lèvres car ca peut nuire à mes rêves
J'me fait scred comme Zorro, la stache-mou de Ramìrez
Les regards sont froids, même dans un climat tropical
La corde au cou depuis l'cordon ombilical sin-cou !
Donc on picole, rêve d'évasion comme dans Ushuaïa
Voler comme un oiseau, dis ca à d'autre, moi j'suis à ie-p

Ca sent la rage de nos ghettos, pour mes noirs, mes arabes
Qui s'débrouillent, un conseil, en cas d'embrouilles c'est pas grave
Ca sent la rage de nos ghettos, faut plus qu'on s'tape comme des cons
Ressortir fait ber-tom, ça donne du taff aux dé-con
Ca sent la rage de nos ghettos, gagner mille euros par mois
Ça nourrit pas une mif donc ca donne un fiston au parloir !
Ca sent la rage de nos ghettos, le seum dans nos abdos
Pendant qu'on fait des sales trucs, Satan lui fait des saltos

On s'tire vers le ba, donne moi ta main j't'arrache le bras
S'embrouille pour un Wonderbra, bref, on est loins d'être braves
Trève de plaisanterie, fini les délires d'ados

Ressortir fait ber-tom, ça donne du taff aux dé-con
Ca sent la rage de nos ghettos, gagner mille euros par mois
Ça nourrit pas une mif donc ca donne un fiston au parloir !
Ca sent la rage de nos ghettos, le seum dans nos abdos
Pendant qu'on fait des sales trucs, Satan lui fait des saltos

That nigga Master P back in the house for the 9-5 shot


Well take a step into this madness that we call the dope game
Richmond, California where us youngstas slang that cocaine
And we be hoppin it up and choppin it up and rockin it up
To tens, twenties, fifties, and hundreds to make our profits bro
Roll through the town talking shit, get your wig split
Especially when fucking with another niggas divendends
I mean them George Washington, them Lincoln, Hamilton, Jefferson
Grant, Ben Franklins
Find your ass in the trunk with your motherfuck corpse stankin, haha
The ghetto's trying to kill me
And if you live to see 95 most of ya'll fools can feel me
Come take a ride in my 6-4
I'm not Dr. Dre but Richmond, California's death row
You got niggas packin heat
And fiends on every corner trying to make them ends meet
And the game get thicker
When you think its all good
Down bows another nigga
To the grave 6 feet deep
I've never seen a man cry but I'm not Scarface G
But I've seen alot of niggas die
Richmond, California the town of the homicide
Got me caught up in a shuffle
Sellin crack to my people, just an everyday hustle
I'm too deep to quit
Cause the game giva a young nigga like me profits

Dead presidents
Still trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents
Dead presidents
Still trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents


Blood shot red eyes off that dank gettin toasted
Khakis wear up creased motherfuckin shirt half way open
And on my stomach spells T-R-U
That's  my click motherfucker, in other words that's my crew
That jumped out this game of crack
To get into this game of rap, to put us on the map
And we ain't takin no shorts
Independent worlwide and us niggas hella roll
Gettin paid like the bank, cook it up like crank
Distribute it to the world like some motherfucking dank
But there's always some sucka ass busta playa hatin
Mother fucker runnin up talking bout you all that nigga
You can't rap nigga, insane fool on crack
I get more bitches than you, fools cock 22
I cock A-K's make niggas run for they duece
And them blue signs is thicker
Cause when you think it's all over, I be the bounty picker
Wiping niggas up like soap, niggas can never go
When you fools was fadin, I was sendin niggas to death row
Committin homicides and drive-bys
Livin with ?????
But still slanging that fuckin pie
And got more bitches than you
So what the fuck you runnin on my set
Talking that hoe shit fool
And No Limit only means the beginning
Cause when the other niggas is fading
We just beginning
Got more juice than ojay
Got more four than fourplay
Got more game than M.J
And like Cube say today will be a good day
25 G's for a key
Hook it up and meet King George, 23rd street
Straight up A-1 sola, no yola, hella folda
Ain't no motherfuckin soda, cook it up like grenola
And we bout to chop the top off
This motherfuckin fire bird, ???????
Oh, and them hoes is the side show
And bustas gettin beat down
Niggas ain't from the town, hoes gettin clowned
And we sicker than sickery
Tricker than trickery
Catch you slippin bitch than you history
Cuase I got a bunch of niggas that shoot it up for with me
I got a bunch of killas watchin out for P
And the game get deep
How can you stop when these niggas out to get your green
You gotta watch your ass
And if you rollin on them thangs nigga, you better watch real fast
And watch close to your enemy
Cause it might be the same nigga sittin right next to you G
And the game gets sad
6 feet deep might be lying your dog ass
Trying to get that cash, trying to move fast
But don't tell a nigga where your stash
You know what I'm saying if ya'll in the game
To all my niggas out their in the game

Do you see it?

[Verse 1]
He was a lost boy with rhythm, heart broke, SYRE has risen
Look at the stars, it's all written, just hold the applause
I'm just gettin' started with it
It's not hot enough in the kitchen, they sayin' it's it
I guess I'm the one thinkin' different, I'm slick with it
A lotta chains, man, I'm Slick Rick and I don't pivot
I'm like Pippen hittin' six swishes in six seconds
Autonomous whippin' while whole colonies are poverty-stricken
Young niggas ain't stoppin' and drippin', the way I dribble the rock
They gotta watch how the rocks are glistenin'
Blood diamonds, ancestors fightin' with colonists
Know your history, inherit the confidence
It's apparent and obvious, I'm the young KRS in your providence
And this air that we're breathin' is consciousness
Every lyric is prominent (I feel it)
[Chorus]
Just another cold mornin' in Paris, I know
I wish I was takin' you home
But I ain't takin' the long train no more (Ah, ah)
You don't care about me and it's tough, girl
And I'm tryna feel your love
But I'm not fucked up enough
Man, what a pity New York City lights glow
How many times I gotta tell you niggas that I'm home?

[Verse 2]
Girl, I ain't finna lie, you gorgeous
We should go to Malibu, let's go to Florence
Rainbow on your aura
Girl, you soakin' up the sun like a tourist (Okay)
Another plane, she an explorer
I'm drinkin' and I'm tellin' her things I'm not sure of
Cancun to Agoura, couldn't find more of a wavy baby
We endin' our month in Bora Bora

[Bridge]
All this time and you're still on my mind, yeah, you know
(Yeah)

[Verse 3]
Girl, I ain't tryna leave, I'll be right back (Why?)
Left the crib without the top, need a nightcap (Yeah)
I'm just lookin' at the stars for my path
I'm serious and get with you, the lyrics all facts
They pop off, you tell 'em, ""Relax""
I drop off the bars and dash let the sunset in the back (Wow)
And the boy's light as a feather in fact
At least we can be together now forever
But if we could fly through a pink sky, we would never go back
[Chorus]
Just another cold mornin' in Paris, I know
I wish I was takin' you home
But I ain't takin' the long train no more (Too far)
You don't care about me and it's tough, girl
And I'm tryna feel your love
But I'm not fucked up enough
Man, what a pity New York City lights glow (Why?)
How many times I gotta tell you niggas that I'm home?

[Verse 4]
We was seventeen years old, at Cartier, we had to cop
Floatin' in my room, it made feel like I'm an astronaut (Astronaut)
Niggas mad at how I acrobat the vocabular
And they whack, these fractions ain't addin' up and I'm back
With the math raps, like the boy invented the abacus
Less of a rapper, more of a strategist
Gotta know that money can't buy happiness
You gotta have a long arm, still in the hills throwing up charcoals
Shit ain't changed, nigga, I'm still the saddest kid up in the game
Think about you, girl, I do that every day
Thoughts I was havin', blew that shit away
When I call you, I just don't know what to say

[Chorus]
Just another cold mornin' in Paris, I know
I wish I was takin' you home
But I ain't takin' the long train no more (Too far)
You don't care about me and it's tough, girl
And I'm tryna feel your love
But I'm not fucked up enough
Man, what a pity New York City lights glow
How many times I gotta tell you niggas that I'm home?
[Post-Chorus]
Higher the view
I wish you could see how I feel
Took three shots, don't drink, drunk
Quick one-on-one, thought I'd never last
Know you're mad, baby do the math
I've been waitin' for it, since I seen you last
Still embarrassed you ain't do me right
But I couldn't care, baby
Girl, I know you smile
You've been away for a while
Oh girl, the way she just forgot how to die all alone
In the dark, we both don't want me to cry girl I know
Fuck this, gonna burn six checks
Get a new necklace, I ain't missin' no texts

digable planets,it's good to be here,1993,"It’s Good to be Here Lyrics[Intro]
Here they are

[Verse 1: Butterfly]
The ticky-ticky buzz, the sun wakes the sky
I fumble through my fuzz and buzz Mister I
Tell him scoop the beats in the flying saucer kit
Meet me at the port with the nickel bags and shit
Told my pops I'm out, earthbound with the crew
He said, ""Butterfly, may the boogie be with you""
Left my moms a note with these quotes on the trunk
It says, ""I split to Earth to resurrect the funk""
A dozen Snapple pops and a little box of eats
Travellin' through space with the funky, funky beats
Stopped at Pluto to cop some petrol
Met some Klingons and got our things on
Cruising Warp Six with Mister Wiggles in the mix
Hendrix passin' P, Star Child get the fix
The saucer shook the heavens with the blooms and the blams
Because when we hit New York, shazam
We droppin' like a comet and this Vulcan tried to Spock it
These Martians tried to do it, but knew they couldn't cop it
The others from our brother planet lands in the flesh
From up in Sector Six, yes, y'all
[Verse 2: Doodlebug, Ladybug, & Both]
And it's good to be here when we landed up on Lex
Stirrin' up the ground with the sound of Doug E. Fresh
And the hard rocking kids that did it for the black
With the Pumas on their feet and the bombers on their back
We learned it and we earned it, so you know you got to hand it
We planned it when we left, how to freak it and to slam it
Add a Ladybug, transformation is complete
For the metamorphosis from the box to the Jeep
And it's good to be here, gettin' fly with the raps
We love it where we from, but we kick it where we at
Bumpin' out with somethin' that pops and transcends
DPs, baby, it's slim, but not thin
In amongst the pebbles, we rocks on your blocks
Soakin' in the ghetto for kids that have not
Slappin' on some skin, when we slam, check the cheers
So we greet their virgin ears with a kiss
It's so good to be here

[Bridge: All]
We jazz up the streets to prove we have beats
Fat jazz, fat styles, and the sound so sweet
And there ain't no doubt that you got to check
Doodle, Silk, Butter, Mecc
It's so good to be here
[Verse 4: Butterfly]
Yeah, baby, that's the style
The jazz can fill a club or papers by the pile
Just ask toy soldier, toy soldier could have told you
At the boomin' funk hut, it was the afro with the butt
So to the flam lovers that crowd in dark spots
To see 'em kick that lingo and grip that little crotch
Now we have arrived with crazy boogie sounds
Get yourself a mate, today's to boogie down
This is all we know, you feel it when we slams
You can hear the love, it comes out in our jams
The hip-hop digging cats just delivering the words
From the ghetto-dwelling youth, to the bourgies in the burbs

[Outro: All]
And it's good to be here, it's good to be here
It's good to be here, yeah, it's good to be here
It's good to be here, it's good to be here
It's good to be here, yeah, it's good

Good evening, insects
Humans too
The Cocoon Club is pleased to present to you tonight, a new band
Straight from Sector Six
And the colorful ghettos of outer space
They're some weird motherfuckers, but they do jazz it up
So let's bring 'em out here, yeah
Uh, thank you, thank you, word, cross
Ever since I was a caterpillar I dreamed of, you know, slamming up Earth, so we're gonna try to do it tonight
Let me introduce you to the insects, the players to you
On life, my main man, this cat is bad, check him out
C-Know, the Doodlebug, alright
On wide grooves, Silkworm
On vibes— What? What?
Yo, chill, man
I don't even know you, man, what you talking about?
Yo, bring it back, bring it back, right now

How you doin', miss? My name is L, I'm from Queens
I heard about your man, he like to lace you with cream
Dolce Gabbana, Moschino with Donna jeans
But he slipped up, and threw his rock to a fiend
He be playin' like a Willie 'cause he dress ya dove
Never knowin' that his woman is in need of love
You got Versace gold link stomach chains with rocks
Official hair style but you stuck up in the spot
Makin love, Duke is weak then he fallin' asleep
You on the phone with your old peeps dyin' to creep 'tween my sheets
So what you got Chanel on your feet
Hot sex on a platter makes the mission complete, uh

Soon as he turn the corner I'ma turn that ass out
Full blown, frontin' in the 6 with the chrome
Yo B, why you leave your honey all alone with me?
Just because you blessed with cash
Doesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that ass
So see the moral of the story is a woman need love
The kind you so-called players never dreamed of
You got to try love, can't buy love
If you play your hand, then it's bye-bye love

You still fakin' jacks throwin' rocks on her hand
See, you put your mack down, now you Nino Brown
Rock roller with so much ice your cap's polar
I got her smokin' beedies, modelin' bikinis
Pushin' your whip on the Van Wyck to see me

What’s up, love?  Welcome to
The Loe Disco.  Verbally, if we can dance, it would
Enhance the show.  I’m saying, “What’s up, love?”  Welcome to
The Probe Disco.  Take a chance on a dance, let
A union advance
[Verse 1: Loer Velocity]
What’s up, love?  Welcome to
The Loe Love Shack.  Don’t just stand there.  Come in, but wipe
Your feet on the mat.  First time here, created atmosphere
I see it in your act.  Aight, let me prove this smooth and take
That load off your back (Relax, love).  I’ve been noted, in fact, to have
The knack of masseuse and make strings on vast
Gore-Tex boots loose (Word?).  For now, I won’t produce that situation
Just relations by way of worded lingo and
Keen optic conversations, oral observations.  See you
Smiling at heart.  As for moderating room temperature
I’m doing my part.  Out the window, love sees art
In the Palace scenery, the way the Hudson flows
Is congruent to lyric machinery, partaking in the greenery
At a cruise rate as you find yourself responding to
The moves that I make.  See, now, the mood is at stake as we contemplate
The situation.  In a roundabout way, I’m nice
With vaginal stimulation, a pubic self-relation
Elations evolve, any question of our affections
Intimately are now solved, our soulful lust collage
Camouflaged by sound, the strobe light effect
Keeps facial expressions drowned

Amp the show, and if you wanna romance, then
Advance to go

How you doing, love?  Welcome to
My club.  You’re looking beautiful like a dove
You must have arrived via somewhere from up above
Señorita keeps me high like drugs
Stays hooking me up with love like plugs
And grub, my boo keeps her man well-fed with rub
In the bedroom, taking boom to the head.  Well, boo
I made this mixtape just for you.  It has
A little Earl Klugh and some El DeBarge.  I love
You in a special way, starting with a massage, and if
You wanna get charged, I got some licks for your lips, so
Your hips could bounce back-and-forth off the sips
Hey, pass that little clip, don’t burn your fingertips.  Are you
With the sticky type of Cool Whip shit?  We could
Dance into the night, romance my shorty right here
I black like three in the track light, my boo’s wrapped tight
In name-brand clothes, but I won’t name those though—that’s for
Them same lame hoes, but, yo, my girl’s special
She shakes her hips like a ship or a vessel
In her breasts, I keep my head nestled, and when we make love
Shit look like I wrestle.  I hate to stress you, but I do
Because you my boo.  You got a fly crew
But, in fact, all them chickens is wack besides you
A fly date is in the sky, pace, some K-Ys, we stay high
I’ll watch your titties gyrate while I
Migrate to your hotspot and hit the jackpot
I’ll make you feel like you hit the crackspot.  Yo, hitting you
All night with those back-shots.  We got
The back-shots.  That’s the Disco

ahmad jamal,time for love,1985,"Beat Breakdowns Vol 3: Illmatic Special Lyrics5. ""Halftime"" – Produced by Large ProfessorThe first of two Large Professor instrumentals we explore is an up-tempo vibe created by trumpets, bass and tambourine that Nas rhymes over. Containing three samples:Vocals and instrumentals from ""School Boy Crush"" by Average White BandBass from ""Dead End"" by Japanese Hair CastWhile the trumpets are from ""Soul ""Travelin' Pt. I (The G.B.E.)"" by Gary Byrd
This was actually Nas first single. Fun fact: Busta Rhymes was offered the beat but passed on even though he love it, he didn't know what to write to it!4. ""Onelove"" – Produced by Q-TipThe track is in fact the early version of ""Memory Lane"" produced by DJ Premier. Q-Tip talks about the process, his inspiration for ""One Love"" and sheds light on their conversation about the production of the song:I told him, ‘Yo, I’m going to give you some spooky sounding shit for your album.’ And Nas was like, ‘Yeah, I need that to capture the feel of what I’m saying. I need that crazy, mysterious shit.’ So that was the vibe of ‘One Love.’ I knew that it was going to be a classic track. I just knew it. It’s one of those special songs that when you work on it you know what it’s going to be.""One Love"" samples the piano and double bass from ""Smilin' Billy Suite Part II"" (1975) by the Heath Brothers. Additionally it contains a drum break from Parliament's ""Come In Out the Rain"" (1970), to add to the song's mystical and hypnotic soundscape!3. ""The World Is Yours"" – Produced by Pete RockPete Rock draws from blues and some avant-garde jazz compositions. The track features scratches from Rock, mellow piano and drums. The song also contains one sample an one interpolation. The piano is sampled from ""I Love Music"" by Ahmad Jamal Trio & parts of the hook is an interpolation of ""Its Yours"" by T La Rock

Rock breaks down the process of the record and describes Nas as ""the most incredible lyricist he's ever worked with""2. ""It Ain´t Hard To Tell"" – Produced by Large ProfessorThis song was produced by long-time collaborator and mentor of Nas, Large Professor.  Large Professor, also known as Large Pro and Xtra P, is a New York City-based hip hop record producer and emcee. He is also best known as a founding member of the influential underground hip hop group Main Source

The track contains 4 samples:Multiple elements from Human Nature by Michael JacksonRiff from ""N.T"" by Kool and The GangDrums from ""Slow Dance"" by Stanley ClarkVocals from ""Long Red"" by Mountain
It opens with guitars and synths of Michael Jackson's ""Human Nature""; the song's vocals are sampled for the intro and chorus sections, creating a swirling mix of horns and tweaked-out voices. Large Professor looped in drum samples from Stanley Clarke's ""Slow Dance"" and saxophone from Kool & the Gang's ""N.T."" While you can hear background vocals shouting yeah from ""Long Red"". The production has an up-beat vibe and lighten mood with braggadocio rhymes!1. ""NY State Of Mind"" – Produced by DJ PremierPossibly Nas' most iconic record, ""NY State Of Mind"" is hip hop in it's purest form. The beat samples Joe Chambers' instrumental jazz composition, ""Mind Rain"". DJ Premier emphasized the lower tones of this sample, while complimenting with an alternate higher toned melody. The drums are consistent to Primo's classic boom-bap sound, and the inclusion off bass throughout provides a strong structure for Nas to flow on smoothly

At the beginning of this song, there is a portion without the sampled piano and a synthed high-pitch sound, higher than any piano note. This sound came from another jazz track, Donald Byrd's ""Flight Time."" Premier has said that this whole song was originally one verse, but he added the hook in the middle to give the audience a chance to digest the first verse and not be overwhelmed by one extremely long/complex verse!9Embed",0.024,0.881,0.095,0.9954

lady saw,give me the reason,1996,"Amnesia Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't know where I'm at or who I am, I'm being asked
If I recognize certain places and faces, scriptures and diagrams
Evaluations to see where my mind is
They said I'll understand in due time but I don't know what time is
They bring a woman in to visit me
And she descriptively begins to give to me vivid periods of my history
I'm trying to figure out who this could be
A mystery it all persist to be, right now I don't even exist to me
She kisses me like she been missing me
Then instantly the doctor gives her paper with twenty words on a list to me
For hours he tried to empower me
And out of the twenty, nineteen I couldn't place but one was jumping out at me
I don't feel crazy, I'm very sane
I'm trying to gain recollection, the doctor matches pictures up to every name
I try to concentrate to remember but nothing comes
I overheard the doctor tell the same lady I'm suffering from Amnesia
[Hook: x2]
My world, ain't the same
Don't know who I am, I don't know my name
Can't remember my life, I can't remember my ways
Can't remember my nights, I can't remember my days

[Verse 2]
Now, they bring me to a different bed and hooked me up to a machine
That gave his thoughts when they strapped it to your head
Was I a righteous man or evil dude, they judged my feelings
To certain words based on how fast the needle moves
My reactions would diversify, the words they said sparked emotion
Some made me laugh and others made me cry
The needle jumped out at a crazy pace and when he said
The word from the list that he gave me, I saw the lady's face
They brought a young child in
Who began to shed tears until he looked into my eyes and started smiling
Like he was happy that he found me, something was familiar about the feeling
When he wrapped his arms around me, listen
Something is coming back, I'm reminiscing
A distant memory of me and this child but there was somebody missing
Where was this other person at, part of this puzzle could be deciphered
If something could bring that person back
It's no mirrors in this room I'm at, to prove this fact
They handed me a picture of myself and I asked em who is that
I start to drag like I'm going mad
It was something making me feel hatred for this picture even though I had
Amnesia
(Hook x2)

[Verse 3]
I tore the picture up and then I screamed
The frustration of not knowing nothing of nobody was just too extreme
Hopes that my memory could be redeemed
I'm still struggling with the one word that seemed to outshine the other 19
They strapped me down like a wild man, the lady walked back in the room
With another female who held the child's hand
When I felt that presence it calmed me, but as they swarmed me
The calm became a storm cause what they sung alarmed me
I heard the hate they spoke with optics blurred
Telling me the reason I forgot them and myself was I forgot the word
Right then I felt it like a gust of wind
A voice said wake up, I heard clapping and I was on a stage with 2 other men
Opened my eyes and realized, G
A hypnotist had hypnotized another man and at the same time hypnotized me
He said raise your arm and hold it up
The other hypnotized man was the Dr and in my hand the list was folded up
I opened it wondering what can it be
It was the 19 words from the fantasy, the list consists of friends and family
Yeah my mother wife and son is who those people was
And the one word from the list that seemed to stand out was the word 'Love'
Suppressed in my subconscience mind, amnesia in this case
Is when love is in you but you forget to show it all the time
Now back to normal, he's converting me
Said I wouldn't recall a thing, went back to my seat
And told Dope, ""I told you it wouldn't work on me""

Doubles get you from that bar, and get you right
Or get you bent, whatever you like
I'm not into wifin' - no sir
I just wanna beat it up, hear the kitty-cat purr
The whip or the tail, whichever you prefer
The crib off limits, got wifey durr
Got a man home beast, then be easy ma
She don't know how to creep, I be teachin' ma
I got jars of that haze, yeah I'll show you how to twist
Get it tight but not too tight, it's all in the lick
I'll show you which end to burn, how to spot that trick
All you need is the will to learn
.. and some good trees to burn
Relax, you'll be straight like a perm, word

I don't wanna scare you away, I'm sayin' whassup
Tell your friends come over here, and party with us
If y'all from the hood, y'all gon' love our ways
Cause we got money, and we still the same way
Go 'head, do that dance, and you can feel free
To be you and just do you, everything's great
Yeah tonight we gon' have a little too much to drink
Just leave your car in the lot, so you can feel safe
We gon' party 'til six then take it to my place
Then later on I'll have a car bring you back safe
I ain't into games, I'll give it to you straight
We can have a part time love, I just want it straight
Really though, I changed dough, not no dames
So however you wanna call it, it's okay

Go and get your other friends, 'cause you comin' with me

So I kick the Dunn language, the response was better
We like, 'Dunn' did it, 'Dunn' hit it, 'Dunn' split it
Everything hon wanted, Dunn was with it
She like to see me doo-rag'd and me ball-cap'd
She like to see me tailored, Gator'd, slacked
In fact, I see you lookin' through the windshield wipers

Used to have quarter thangs but now I got quarter dames
Got a quarter of a new vehicle and quarter chains

warren g,do you see,1994,"Do You See Lyrics[Intro: Gil Scott-Heron]
The blues has always been totally American
As American as apple pie
As American as the blues
As American as apple pie
The question is why
Why should the blues be so at home here?
Well, America provided the atmosphere

[Verse 1]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
I take a look over my shoulder, as I get older
Getting tired of mothafuckas saying, ""Warren I told ya""
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
With these funny-bunny niggas, ain't shit changing
Got my Mama wondering if I'm gang banging
But I don't pay attention to these father figures
I just handle mine, and I'm rolling with my niggas
Off to the VIP, you see Snoop Dogg and Warren G
Unbelievable how time just flies
Right before your eyes, but you don't recognize
Now who's the real victim, can you answer that
The nigga that's jacking or the fool getting jacked?
[Chorus]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

[Verse 2]
Another sunny day, another bright blue sky
Another day, another muthafucka die
These are the things I went through when I was growing up
There's only one hood, and niggas shit be throwing up
And I knew it, there really ain't nothing to it
Thinking every fool's gotta go through it
Now let's go back, how far, back in time
Dragging to these hookas trying to mack for mine
I remember when we all used to stop at the spot
Back then my nigga-name was Snoop Rock
It was all so clear, '87, '88, then '89s the year
You say everywhere we roll, you can say we roll thick
Way back then 2-1-3 was the clique
Servin' to stay paid I was just a young hog
Warren G, Snoop Rock and Nate Dogg

[Chorus]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
[Verse 3]
You make me wanna holla, get out the game
Too many muthafuckas know my name
While Snoop Dogg's serving time up in Wayside
I puts it down on the street, don't try to take mine
I had to reassure the homie that he wasn't alone
We'd talk, and him and Nate'd conversate on the phone
He kept saying, ""Nigga, it won't be long
Before a little skinny nigga like me'll be home""
I said ""Snoop, things done changed, it's not the same
We need to get up out the game
'Cause we can get paid in a different way
With you kicking dope rhymes and I DJ""
Well as time goes past, slowly we try to make it
But things are getting hectic, I just can't take it
Should I, A: Go back to slanging dope
Or should I, B: Maintain and try to cope
Or should I, C: Just get crazy and wild
But no, I chose D: Create the G-Child
It's been on ever since with me and Mista Grimm
This shit is getting so hectic that I can't even trust him now
What would you do for a Warren G cut
Would you act the fool and nut the fuck up
Back the fuck up, act the fuck up
Niggas talk shit they get smacked the fuck up, straight up

You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

I'm not your average MC with the Joe Schmoe flow
If you don't know me by now, you'll never know
Stepping on my critics, beating on my foes
The plan is to stay focused, only then I can grow
Straight from the heart, I represent hip hop
I be three albums deep, but I don't wanna go pop
Too many candy rappers seem to be at the top
Too much candy is no good, so now I'm closing the shop
Crushing competition like Italians on grapes
My rhymes styles be blending like a Ron G tape
My man where ya going, you can't escape
When the Tribe is in the house that means nobody is safe
How can a reverend preach, when a rev can't define
The music of our youth from 1979
We rap by what we see, meaning reality
From people busting caps and like Mandela being free
Not every MC be with the negativity
We have a slew of rappers pushing positivity
Hip hop will never die yo, it's all about the rap
So Mayor Barry smoking crack, let's preach about that
The trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter
The more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter
When I talk, I know I'm talking for Hip Hoppers all around
You know you love the sound, we gets down

Ladies make a forum on your sexual drive
Devote it to your lover and make it thrive

Release my energy with the force of a shotty
Standing on the wall with my Polo on
Talking to the girl with the Liz Claiborne
Keep the poetry in my black knapsack
Got my Timbo hooves and my Doublemint pack
Hit the city streets to enhance my soul
I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
With a kick, snare, kicks and high hat
Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
I can do a trick with the opposite breed
I used to down 40s and smoke grade weed
Now, I'm doing shows with half loot down

We gon take this one over to 275 Halsted

We gon take it over to 155 Morgan
144 Harrison

[Chorus]
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
[Verse 1]
Well it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neighborhood
Can't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good
I'm with whatever comes my way, hip-hop hooray
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain old Dana today
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, TECs, jimmy hats, in case I need protection
So I Land Cruise, pump sounds, play out wanna be’s
A kid in a M3's getting jacked right in front of me
So I play the TEC close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't wanna get wet, so they steps 'cause mine's is slightly bigger
But better yet I'm a threat, so you better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk, 'cause I don't wanna talk
I stay true blue, I'm hoping it's you too
I got the fever for the flavor of a Woo Woo
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus]
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
[Verse 2]
Time to chill, hit the hill uptown, let's peep the sights
Shoot some pool, act a fool, 'cause it's on tonight
I'm doing the knowledge, it's not easy, easy
Watching a cop cuff a kid for selling a clip to a DT
But it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next?
Stomach ache, head to Steak-N-Take for a bean pie
Get a Final Call from the brother in the bow tie
I'm where little kids dream and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter moms, no pops playing with her son
I passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven
Fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game
You know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus]
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
[Verse 3]
You know I gotta give props, I can't stop, without y'all, I'll be nothin
No wreckin', no checks, and no rhymin', no cuttin'
No stages, front pages, no phones, no beepers
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah
I come with the real life perspective and rule
'Cause me and my peoples from around the way remain cool
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day, around the way, around the muthafuckin' way

[Chorus]
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the *gunshot*, but I'm here to stay
'Cause it's just another day, in the neighborhood
Just another day around the way
I'm feelin good today
I'm feelin lovely-yay

Man I remember being so naïve
When life was good weather
And palm trees
Back in the day
You were everything I need
But then along came a time
When you crushed my dreams
Oh yeah you played me like a fool
When you made me believe
That the line between love
Wasn't thick enough to read
Oh yea, you see we in despair
Crime everywhere
You sell false hope cause you just don’t care
Nah uh
You just don't care
Nah nah, nah nah
You just don't, just dont
Care
You just don’t
Still selling false hope cause you just don't care

House nigga
Field nigga
If we talk to a uniform
Who the real nigga
Don't you know we in the deep south
So let's keep it real nigga
This is where they use to mob drag lynch and kill niggas
I Never made it to that party
Cause I failed that paper bag test
Gotta get this money all that well
Cause I ain't neva had it
Feeling like Badu the way I carry my baggage
This heavy load on my shoulders might turn me to a savage

Is that why I gotta fight to get respect
That's a sham
Who's the blame
I don't know
But all I know
Is that we rocking them chains
Still taking that whip
Still tryna get paid
Still tryna find god
Still tryna act saved
Put a youngin on the corner
Now he winning
By twenty-seven
He’ll be dead or in prison
Shampoo, yeah
These are the terrible conditions
That we bind and we put inside the mind of our children

Can’t you see we in despair
Look around we got crime everywhere
But you still sell false hope
Mmmmmh
Cause you just don't care
No you just don’t care
No you just don't care
You just don't care
(You just don't care)

I hope my nigga can really go make a difference
Instead of being the people incarcerated in prisons
Never got caught up for dealing or holding that stolen pistol
So this one goes to Warren, my Granny, Justus, and Crystal
Hol Up
If you ain’t adept
Careful with yo step
Get yo soul in line
Chasing after checks
If you ain't inclined
To say what's on your mind
Please don't throw yo stones at me
For speaking what's on mine

Man Still don't felt that comfy in my own skin (Nah)
Hard to find your worth as a broken kid
Those frames never held a image of my own kin
That's why a rap sheet the only place we fitted in
Yeah
You can go to court
Or you go on the court
You do 9 to 5
Or you go play a sport
Can't represent the house
If you out on the field
If you forget your place
You might turn Emmit Till
Watch em' legislate to execute my brothers that they kill
Got me talking bout my problems as a way for me to heal
I went looking for a Beverly
When I went to the hills
But I came back with a Diamond
And a couple Dollar Bill's
Now they got me saying

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't you see we in despair
Got crime everywhere
Dark clouds in the air
If
You don't know the game
Then
They ain't playing fair
Still selling false hope to you cause they don't care

(They don't, love you)
I remember being so naive
(They don't)
Back when life was compared to
(Need you, they just wanna)
Good weather and palm trees
(Be you)
Back in those days
(It's true)
You were everything that I thought that I need
(More than you'll ever know)
But then along came a time when you crushed my dreams
(Fasho)
You really played me for a fool
When you made me believe
That the line between love wasn't thick enough to read
Cause you know they say
It's a thin line between love and hate

This is it and you know I'll run it freestyle
To the club to see En Vogue, I'll run a country mile
A dope hat, combat boots, I'm comin', cutie pies
Yo, I know En Vogue will love me 'cause I'm too fly
My jerkin' dance'll make 'em stare, and yo, give a laugh
Ask them to dance, they'll look me over and say, 'Oh no, we'll pass'
That's okay, I'll just dance and do my own thang
But when the night is over they'll remember Wayne Wayne

Clasp my hands to pray the power that I left will guide you to a coup de grace

Getting thrown far

Chopping redneck chicken necks I ain't saying nothing
To the hillbilly, stick my barrel in his eye
Boomshacka boomshacka hair chunks in the sky
Why, I never liked chicken pot pie
Or the chopped chicken on rye
So tell Mr. Billy Bob I'ma cut his neck up
Slice, poke, chop chop, stab, cut
What can you do with the drunken hillbilly?
Cut his fucking eyes out and feed 'em to his Aunt Nilly
Willy Willy chicken neck, chicken hunting gotta love it
Hit him with the twelve gauge bucket, chicken nuggets
Laid out all over the grass
Then his little hound dog will eat 'em up fast

Shit was timeless a year ago, every time and its bonkers
Every time in the concert
Spitting my life's pain
Stuck in a light reign
I marathon and I bomb -- pray Boston
Proceed, crazy I seen my city in need in the same way
Armed to the tee in a bomber and tee
Olajuwon at his peak, this the drama that bleeds
Role models was no college
The bold, honest niggas in Foamposites, an old Honda
A couple keys in the seats
Gotta survive on the street
To escape this Section 8 zone that I zone out of
A lone house on a block in the middle of Stone Mountain
Alone, counting the ways I could get radio plays
But I'd rather be myself, don't be a slave to the day
I'll toast to anyone who's devoted, fuck them niggas they over

OK, its DB/ im writing freely/ Like im graffiti
Spraying on the wall its
No not the tallest, but im flawless
Even every part is, who would of thought it Would be easy
But we work the hardest

Verse 4 - TRW
To be them authors, the Don Dadas
My shot is water, it must be awkward
To have to always be a target of Marcellus Wallace
All these girls working somebody get 'em a hardhat
All these herbs acting somebody give 'em a call back
Tarmac, been fly since a nigga needed a hall pass
Now I post up with a passport, imported cash
Now I twist up with DB, we use to go to school scheme on the freaks

Then sit on me, that's what I'ma squeeze fifty
Pretty swiftly 'til them coppers come and get me
Tried to tell his coward ass it's real
Actin' like I can't get through that Slomin shield

Safe cracker, moved from New York to Jers'
Still send kites through birds

SevynTheVillain

[Verse 1]
Yeah, ayy
Runnin' from my problems daily, I'm lappin'
Lately, been relapsing on my flaws
And my bad habits, I've been sad
I broke up with my ex, he don't find me attractive
He just tell me he still loves me just so he can keep me trapped
I messed it up with my day one that rocked with me before I rapped
Held my problems so long, he ended up seeing me snap
Every time I hit em', it's a bunch of ""I'mma call you backs""
With no call back, I lost my only friend, I hate myself for that
I hate myself for everything I do, everything I say
Everything I lose and everything I made
I don't do this for you, don't this for they
I've been on the move, I'm too young to stay
Got ADD, I can't even keep my mind in place
How imma stay? been messed up for awhile
F ya meditate, and namaste's
I don't even talk to God, no more so TBH
How I'mma pray?
Don't even got things figured out but life keep screaming ""Andale!""
My mind be holdin' so much weight, I don't even know what I'mma say
But they say suck it up, this the life you was given
Second guessed thoughts when I thought I even said and I meant it
I want a Frank drive in the ocean and a Rove that is rented
'Cause all this pain I went through left me so dented
Everybody actin' different to me, probably paranoid and I'm trippin'
I don't go out, I don't like the attention
And not to mention
Niggas fake, they hate me now, want me dead
But they act like they gon' all love me
When I'm gone and I'm finished
Let's talk about it, damn
[Chorus: E. Foster]
My thoughts are getting really scary
I just pray it ain't hereditary
We all know we gotta die
Got me moving military
I almost lost me, even though I think
I'm the reason we all eat
Everybody visions but visions is all me
Just being that I'm perfect
Is flaws that I see, yeah

[Verse 2: Deetranada]
Uh, change is not hereditary
Love and scared, scared to love, I hate February
I've been close to death a 100 times, I guess it can be scary
Life ain't really hit me til' the 7th day of January
I ain't even gonna jump in the matter
But in that hospital bed
All I heard from demons was laughter
I beat my wrist up so much
They thought I nigga got battered
Moral of the story, a sister almost ended her chapter
But ayy, I'm still here, nigga I lived
I only care about the quality (Kweli), word to Talib
I kept it moving and I'm actin' like it ain't even happen
Kinda like how family act when you tell em' you saddened
Now that's some sad shit
All my life I grew up as the outcast, the bad kid
The shut your mouth, your goin' through a phase, you ain't sad kid
Never won rewards for none, you ain't never had shit
So I'm gonna count it up and spend it til' I vanish
Magic I never believed in it
I hate bringing it up cause I feel I'm relieving it
I hope I come to peace with Diamond
So I'll say ""We did it!""
I appreciate the grit in her because we really lived it
Always dreamed of livin' lavish
Now I got LV's on my belt
Guard heart with all my demons
They don't know how I felt
That's why I want all the smoke, I load the G's in the L's
Because the main person always fighting me was myself
Damn
[Chorus: E. Foster]
My thoughts are getting really scary
I just pray it ain't hereditary

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Last night I had a dream that was so real
I woke up in a cold sweat, it felt so ill
I stared into the face of an angel
Tainted by the city, you ain't from this place it'll change you
Walkin by, I thought I was sly
Offered to try, at first I thought she was shy
'Til I saw this guy at the bar talkin to her reckless
She ignored him, cast a glance in my direction, started dancin to my section
... Her body flyer than a jet pilot
What a smile and the eyes like wet violets
They flutter by like the wings of the butterfly
Keep it tight, Eva Mendes in The Other Guys
Got me in another zone - they call her Sunshine like
""Put your mother on the phone, I ain't comin home""
Put a deposit on a place in her heart
All along she a place from the start

É nois que tá na fita agora pode crê
Brasil crescendo a gente tá ai para aparecer
Se voce quiser colar com a gente, não tem nada não
A gente vai correndo junto nessa mesma união
Brasil o povo de mistura raca pé no chão
Objectividade na vontade de crescer
[Verse 2]
A feeling of panic engulfin the whole planet
Yet my words are slow dancin, my language is romantic
Vocabulary that's bustin your capillaries
My freedom'll taste sweeter than juices of blacker berries
My adversaries speak I'll of my name, I'm so sick
Attack is very guerilla, my game is so pimp
Everything fall into place, it's gravitational
Profit stay in the black, the shade is so un-fadeable
Healthy relationship make your other ones better
I'm Lee Scratch Perry, they call me the upsetter
For the cheddar get the bread up
Mr. International call it the bruschetta, the spiritual newsletter
I wish you knew the arc of the story and knew your part
You're lookin into my heart or just lookin to be a part
From a boss in my prime, look how we crossin the finish line
How you tired, I stay wired like I was offered a line

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uh, uh
I don't wanna bang it or beat it, hit it or stab it
You're listenin to voodoo, I call it the black magic
You jammin up the traffic, you bubble, it don't stop
It might blow up but it won't go pop
""Pow!"" That's the sound like onomatopoeia
Got me floatin when you (Rockin My Boat) like you Aaliyah
Got them African features like people out in Bahia
Mix tobacco with the reefer like you was a European
When I leave I'm gonna miss you, (Official) like Kardinal
Trust I'll come back and I'll visit for carni-val
When I come back around, take me out on the town
And you can show me how you put it down

Inna 1934 German elect a leader and what was his name it was Adolf Hitler
And the rest of the world a call him the Führer

But now inna the 1990 the cry is for powa
And all of mankind is living inna danga
Because the conflict jah mon between the supapowa
And east blame west hour after hour
And north accuse south every 5 hour

Fight fi powa dis a di fight fi powa-wa-wa

Long long ago before Christ receive ya'
There was an evil man who name Julius Ceasar
Who invade Jerusalem and he was seeking powa
And a nuff nuff nuff nuff nuff is the life him slaughta
Then him declare himself Jah-Jah and then take ova
But how can a mortal guy be Jah-Jah
Without supernatural and mystic powa
So me say a couple years afta Jah-Jah lick him ova

(Background chatter)
This is how we do it!
(This is how we do it!)
Sha la la la la la lo
Shabada lo lo lo, whoa
(This is how we do it!)
Lo lo lo low-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, ""Monty, yo, we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say
[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

[Verse 2]
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say...

[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
Y?N-Vee, SCC (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
[Verse 3]
Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6' 8"" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're makin' tha dash

[Chorus]
Ohh, I'm buzzin' because... (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)

South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)

Oh, it's party time! (This is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the West Side (This is how we do it)
OG's got the flavor, yeah (This is how we do it)

My rhymes create life like the birds and the bees
Make Funkmaster Flex say 'Yo, I'm feelin' these'
Flows make you shit in your drawers, change your dungarees
Smokin' trees, gettin' cottonmouth, wild munchies
Bounce down the block, eat food at Luigi's
Ass constipated — too much extra cheese
But anyway, while I was coolin' down at Luigi's
I met some Siamese twins from overseas.. Lebanese
Lesbians with the friends from New Orleans
They had a fifth friend, she was straight Black-Portuguese
Pretty palm-olive-soaped skin, Aloe Vera leaves
She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
The type of chick you would KILL for to get between the knees
Yo, I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese
Would you believe the bitch tried to steal my fuckin' house keys? Rob me for my G's
Had to show this crazy broad I mastered my degrees and my Ph.D's
Got yo' face on camera — motherfucker, say cheese!
You better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze
Gettin' caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees

So do good in your hood, even though you puff lye
Positive to comply, don’t screw face and act rah
Progress, don't fall back, we can't have that
I'll hold your hand, Black, we can't wind up with scratch
I put my best foot forward when I play this life
'Cause this world is bound to get ya like a double-edged knife

Make things get hot, like the .44 shot? (Blaow!)
No, we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek
In the world that we live, kindness is viewed as weak
So, we got to stay on point for all these lizards and snakes
Some of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes
We decipher all the frauds and build grounds with our friends

Yo, Na Na so Ill, first week out
Shipped a half a mil', niggas freaked out
She's all about sex, pardon, check your facts
And the track record, I'm all about plaques
Shaking my ass half-naked, lovin' this life
Waitin' for Kim album to drop, knowin' it's tight
Standing center stage, closin' the show holdin' a gat
Since you opened up, I know you're hoping it's wack
Niggas screamin' my name on record, straight wildin'
Maybe I'll answer back when you reach a hundred thousand
This is ladies night, and the Mercedes tight
When I'm coming home? Maybe tonight
Leave my food by the microwave, kiss the baby goodnight
It's my time to shine, it's playtime tonight
'Member tryna stand my ground, know when I fall
I left your ass home alone, hopin' I call

Who got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin' down, niggas can't stand it, the Ill Na Na

While I'm lookin over your shoulder, watching the hall light
You hate when it's a ball, right? Ladies, this ain't handball
Nigga, hit these walls right before I call Mike
In the morning when it's all bright, eggs over-easy
Hope you have my shit tight when I open my eyes
While I'm eating getting dressed up, this ain't your pad
I left some money on the dresser, find you a cab
No more, sharin' our pain, sharin' our maid
It's time to outslick niggas, ladies sharin' our game
Put it in high gear, flip the eyewear
Nas ruled the world, but now it's my year
And from here on, I solemnly swear
To hold my own like Pee Wee in a movie theater (Uh-uh)
Yeah, I don't need a man's wealth (Yeah)
But I can do bad by my damn self (Self), and, uh

This is some of the lingua franca of the funk business
And people come from miles around
With  an almost religious devotion to get on down

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
[Verse 1]
What up everybody, so glad you're here
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage, but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention
Now I wants to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk
When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C-
Double O-L-I-O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know
One, two, three, it's like A, B, C
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
Slide, slide, but that's that past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor

If you got beef, then nigga, eat a pork chop
Once I get it goin', you know it don't stop
I break like anti-locks, panties drop
From hood to hood, block to block
Help, I need somebody
To get it goin' on in this party
Baby, you can do it, take your time do it right
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night
My name ain't Wanda, but I'll rock your world
Get more bounce than a jheri curl
Too many looky loos be lookin' for clues
There's a party goin' on, now what'cha gonna do, so
Grab your partner, do-si-do
Now if you don't know who it is, it's Coolio
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
One, two, three, four
Get your woman on the floor
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
Gotta—gotta get up to get down
[Verse 3]
Push, push, in the bush
But don't step on my toes 'cause you might get smushed
It's the brother from around the way
And what I say I bend a co'ner on three like Dr. Dre
Comin' at 'em with a pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope he don't trip 'cause I don't want to have to gat 'em
So move your body baby, drive the homies crazy
The way you shake that ass, it always amaze me
Ain't no party like a west coast party
'Cause a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga in a Chevy hittin' switches
Then you gotta give the nigga his props
I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to get the party open
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

But you couldn't make my day (Hey!)
I'm rockin' and you're yawnin'
But you never look my way (Hey!)
I'm lickin' down your darlin'
In every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way
This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your head and shoulder
Brother older, bold enough to fold ya, yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save yo' flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit
Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real, so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what you're thinkin', 'cause I'm vampin'
I live and die for hip-hop, this is hip-hop for today
I give props to hip-hop, so Hip Hop hooray

You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground
Bein' low down, I do the showdown with any little ho 'round
No! I wanna know who you believe in
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheatin'
You said: ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo, PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit, not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not 'cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like somethin' really big is missin'
Even though my name's graffiti-written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way

One reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what you heard 'cause I ain't bailin' no hay
Ain't choppin' no crops, but still growin' every day
Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns, beatdowns are found
Don't know me? Don't come around!
Tippy tippy (pause) tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat 'em up
Your styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout-out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitties purr, now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew; any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver's name is Mook
I hittin' woodies in a hoodie
Peace to Josette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood G
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S. and Quest

us3,just another brother,1993,"Just Another Brother LyricsMy brother, take a rest from what you doin' sit back and listen
Listen to my song about some brothers on a mission
This one kid he never went to school
His teachers thought that he was crazy out acting the fool

But on a real, baby pa had nuff static
He had two little brothers and his mother was a crack addict
Papa bear was never there to give him hope
So one might ask himself how did this young man cope?

He started robbin' just to feed his peoples and that's a fact
Until one day he got caught in the act
Shacked up and jacked up and taken downtown
And to the judge he's just another brother on lock down
Just another brother, just another, just another brother
Just another brother on lock down
Just another brother, just another, just another brother
Just another brother on lock down

Just another brother, just another, just another brother
Just another brother on lock down
Just another brother, just another, just another brother
Just another brother on lock down

Well, this other nigga from the Fort was out to get his
Catchin' crazy wreck on the mic, that's word to Mizz
But until he struck the deal he had to sell the rock
Pack the Glock doin' deeds at the end of the block

He had crazy fly robes and his daughter ate well
He never hit the blowpipe it was strictly the sell
These jealous brothers round the way wanted to rock his world
But instead they did the dirty shit and shot his girl

When he found out who did it he went awol
Stepped to the mall, he saw the punks and sprayed them all
But now he's doin' life for the suckers he shot down
And now he's just another brother on lock down

Just another brother, just another, just another brother
Just another brother on lock down
Just another brother, just another, just another brother
Just another brother on lock down
Just another brother, just another, just another brother
Just another brother on lock down
Just another brother, just another, just another brother
Just another brother on lock down

Fresh outta school my man had it all
A dip crib, a fly girl, he was havin' a ball
But this other punk kid started to use him and abuse him
Slowly takin' all his loot and at the same time confuse him

When the smoke cleared my man lost his crib and his bank
And may I ask a question, who'd he have to thank?
Well, anyway, now he's on a mission to get his respect
He thinks the only way to get it is to catch his wreck

He saw the bastard in the Village, on Astor Place
My man balled up his fist and laid him to waste
Now he's getting' five years even though he got props now
But to you and me he's just another brother on lock down

Just another brother, just another, just another brother

I'm on like Dr. John, yeah, Mr. Zu Zu
I'm a newlywed, not a divorcee (yeah)
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey
Well it's the taking of the Pelham 1, 2, 3
If you want a doo doo rhyme, then come see me
I've got the savoir faire with the unique rhymin'
I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and
Strictly handheld is the style I go
Never rock the mic with the pantyhose
I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go
‘Cause at the boards is the man, they call the Mario
You pull up at the function and you know I Kojak
To all the party people that are on my Bozac
I've got more action than my man, John Woo
And I've got mad hits like I was Rod Carew (yeah)

And on the microphone, I come correct
Timing like a clock when I rock the hip-hop
Top notch is my stock on the soapbox
I've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs
And that's a lot because I've got my share (oohh, weee)
I've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
I gotta straighten my thoughts
I'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit
Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
I'll have to step back, I gotta contemplate
Well, I'm like Lee Perry, I'm very on
Rock the microphone, and then I'm gone
I'm like Vaughn Bode, I'm a Cheech Wizard

The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end
Well, you say I'm twenty-something and I should be slacking
But I'm working harder than ever and you could call it macking
So I'm supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my TV
I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD
Well, I'm that kid in the corner
All fucked up and I wanna so I'm gonna (yeah)
Take a piece of the pie, why not, I'm not quittin'

B-boy, where the fuck you at?
I been looking for your ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer, that's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
You're getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vexed and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body
Whose body, your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boot
Now let me take sight to you loving the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right

Keep on, keep keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love's so brand new
Keep on keep keepin' on
Doin' it right, right, right

Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose?
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to going home at night
Brother does me right under the candlelight
Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that?
A-yes, I can, can, why not
If I wanna, yes, I can, can
More honey than a bumblebee hive
Pulling sixty-nine ways out my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga
Juicy like Hi-C or an Icee
I got the shit to make your ass write a bad check
'Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I proceed to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Ven aqui and I'll get rid of all company

Many have tried strict regulations
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ringin', ringin' my bell
You're playing with my time, tryna jerk me
Hurt me then desert me, you better work me
While you got the opportunity
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E
Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info of my sheets in the street
'Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boot on a video shoot
But it's all good though, you gotta get it when you want it
Sight your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame, get the name and kick the game

I'm a queen on the mic, and it's true when I say
That the Pepa MC is here to stay
And you know if I was a book, I would sell
'Cause every curve on my body got a story to tell
Yeah, word 'em up (Word 'em up)
W-word 'em up (Word 'em up)

'Cause I'm oh-ah, I'm on, I'm on
Yes, I'm oh-ah, I'm so damn on
Like a grasshopper hoppin' on the morning lawn

And you know I got to be on
MC's rockin' and shockin', but it won't last
Salt's on the mic, and I'm kickin', ask
Me no questions, I'll tell no lies
It's just a little warning, a word to the wise
You been hopin' and scopin', layin' and prayin'
But on the bottom is where you're staying
You're wack (Hahaha), I thought you understood
You're not related to me so you could never be good
I know you come from Babylon (And you know why?)
'Cause you're a babble-on MC (That's right)
You babble on the microphone about what you wish
But could never be, so please
Don't tell me how you're gonna rock
Don't brag about the things that you ain't got
Don't feed me lines 'cause now I'm full

Why do they call you the Pepa MC?
You mean you don't know? (Uh-uh) That's a shame
Okay, Salt, let me explain

[Verse 3]
I'm hot like a fire, burned down, diminished
Oh, now I see! Chill, let me finish
I wanna make one and all understand
I don't play, I slay when the mic's in my hand
The room temperature reaches a hundred and four
You can scramble eggs on the floor
Blood pressure soars, the crowd, they roar
Sweat will drip down to your drawers

And I paid the price to make the mic sound nice

Forget about the rest, yes, I don't jest
You're blessed with one of America's best

When Salt's in the house, hell's in session

Rockin' to my funky beat
I'm a trip so I know you're gonna fall for me
'Cause this is the year all men fear

That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door (You know)
They might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote TECs and stuff, to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked

Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?

Light the blunt clip and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week

She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with a female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gangbang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you

Wanna talk girls?  You can’t follow this — I’ve been

I turn emcees red fast
I’ll never sell out — fuck that, yo, I’m deadass

But, no, it’s not Batman.  It’s the original
Blackman that goes back like the Gap Band

We used to do the dance we called, ""wubby-wubby""
Now S.T.P. 1993
So Hollywood, get out my way
My mom's word seems like yesterday:
""Love Jesus, don't forget to pray""
She most have gone with the boss D.J., right?
(""Don't be too sure of that, fat one.""
""Fat one?"")
And feelin' love, so skinny-ny-ny
Comin' with the 9 millimeter, point your gun and bullet free (Bang)
'Cause he who has the money, has the authority
And respect to the man with the Uzi
(""Pretty handy with a six gun, myself"")
The 808 kick is on my hit list
And this beat's cooking like an Ital Dish
It wasn't hard for me to do, it was so easy
Because to me, loops looped tight come naturally
Mom's words seemed like yesterday
(Cough)

(""What's your name?""
""Cisco Kid""
""Si, Pancho's name is, Pancho"")
[Verse 2]
Now in '94, we got an S.T.P
A half pack of smokes, and oh yes, Aunt B
A fifteen pack of Old Milwaukee
A dalmatian and a girlfriend
But I ain't got no money-ney-ney-ney
The 808 is within my reach
Sublime posse come straight from Long Beach
If you think that Hollywood didn't get what he deserved
Call 808, kid, and get served

(How am I gonna get a scar like that eating pussy, man?)

(""There's always some hombre that can't resist swappin' lead just to see if their faster with the six gun than Cisco is.""
""He-he-he, those hombres find out Cisco the fastest!""
""Well that don't stop 'em from tryin', Pancho, like Slade, here: he fancies himself as fast on the draw as them quarter-horse takin' after a stray.""
""Oh-ho-ho, that one not gon' beat Cisco, either!""
""Well, what's the matter? Can't the Cisco Kid talk for himself? Is that how you got your reputation, Cisco, by havin' your partner build you up?""
""I make no claim to a reputation, señor, and no one has to talk for me.""
""The Cisco Kid, huh? The kid part of it fits you from the way you act.""
""I've meet with your kind before. (Cat scream)
You're a foolish hombre if you think he will not fight you.""
""You're making big talk for an hombre who will not fight.""
""You are wrong, Slade. I'll fight you any place, any time -- if there is a good reason.""
""Well here's a fistful of reasons!""
""Now, you two quit that.""
""Just as soon as I finish off this Cisco Kid.""
""You are the one that is finished, braggart!""

""I'll take this up with you another time.""
""Any time, hombre. I'd be glad to accommodate you.""
""I'll make it soon, Cisco.""

Yes, I got more bounce than the fucking bump
And then you want to know why
Because I'm motherfuckin' truckin'
I'm in the pocket just like Grady Tate
Got supplies of beats so you don't have to wait
Cause I'm the master blaster, drinking up the Shasta
My voice sounds sweet cause it has to
So light a match to my ass cause I'm blowin' up
I'd like to thank the people for just showin' up
But now I want y'all to move it
Put your point on the floor and just prove it
And I'm smurfin', not rehearsin', gettin' live, y'all
A little puffy, so you know what, I'm doin' right
Cause that's the kind of frame of mind I'm in
I got this feelin' that it's back again
So don't touch me, cause I'm electric
And if you touch me, you'll get shocked
[Mike D]
You got, you got, you got, you got, you got
You've got the boomin' system, but it's sloshing out doo-doo
You think it's chocolate milk, but it's watered down Yoo-hoo
I've been through many times in which I thought I might lose it
The only thing that saved me, has always been music
We've got our own studio, the Son of the G
It's no question, life's been good to me
Cause life ain't nothing but a good groove
A good mixtape to put ya in the right mood
This one goes out to my man, the Groove Merchant
Coming through with beats for which I've been searching
Like two sealed copies, of expansions
I'm like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions
The logo I sport is the face of the monkey
Union made, Ben Davis-quality, it's no junk, see?
My chrome is shining, just like an icicle
I ride around town on my low-rider bicycle

[MCA]
So many wack emcees, you get the TV bozak
Ain't even gonna call out your names, cause you're so wack
And one big oaf, who's faker than plastic
A dictionary definition of the word spastic
You should have never started something that you couldn't finish
Cause writin' rhymes to me is like Popeye to spinach
I'm bad ass, move ya fat ass, cause you're wack, son
Dancing around like you think you're Janet Jackson
Thought you could walk on me to get some ground to walk on
I'll put the rug out under your ass as I talk on
I'll take you out like a sniper on a roof
Like an emcee at the fever in the DJ booth
With your headphones strapped, you're rockin' rewind/pause
Tryin' to figure out what you can do to go for yours
But like a pencil to the paper, I got more to come
One after another, you can all get some
So you better take your time and meditate on your rhyme
Cause your shit'll be stinkin' when I go for mine
And that's right, y'all, don't get uptight, y'all
You can't say shit because you're biting what I write, y'all
And that's wrong, y'all, over the long haul

Who the fuck is this, pagin' me at 5:46 in the morning?
Crack of dawn and now I'm yawnin'
Wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this pagin' me and why
It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
When you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you
I got the MAC, nigga, tell me what you gonna do
[Chorus]
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & Pop]
They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib
You bought your moms out in Florida, the Fifth Corridor
Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin' and flower-bringin'
If my burglar alarm starts ringin'
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament
Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I'ma hit you with, you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun, he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more, nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
I'm not runnin', nigga, I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'

Haiku D'Etat

[Verse 1: Myka 9]
Our genre is in a state of Johnny come late
Awkward armor
Won't tear the skin off a cherry harmless
Can't scrape the surface of a grape
Snake charmer raking in at an alarming rate
Bad karma bait for entrapment
Warning wait before debate dharma
Find your own style warm up
Practice - rehearse
Tune in to what's boomin'
Soon a verse will match a track that hits worth the while
To develop your own pocket for rap tricks
Their organization will collapse quick stylistic
The current so called aristocracy
Of the underground and mainstream have a vacuum
People were taken from home and culture
Poachers stole our beliefs and wardrobe no closure
Suppressed the music and tools in school abusive
Unless you were privileged
But hip-hop found a way over the inner-city village
What happened to the days of climbing charts and reading them too
What we need to do is be more haiku to determine who'll rule
[Hook]
Intelligence is raiding
Ignorance is fading - Dignity
Haiku D'Etat's a poetry takeover
Path that we are paving
Road that we are taking - Integrity
Haiku D'Etat's a poetry takeover
Community educating
Woman and man relating - Unity
Haiku D'Etat's a poetry takeover
Legislature changing
Because of demonstrating - Victory
Haiku D'Etat

[Verse 2: Aceyalone]
When the time comes where the art
Is in the hearts of the people
They'll take you & keep you
Away from these evils
But until then you're subject
To the burning of the churches
The books & the artwork
And the findings to the searches
Black ball of the music
Controlling of the airwaves
Hoping for a clearway
When it's crowded up on the fairway
Locked up at the entrance
Blocked up at the exit
The soldiers on the front line
And the gun line that protects it
The hiding of the scriptures
The order of a new world
The red pill or the blue pill
Divides us into 2 worlds
Seizing of the regions
Taking of the spirit
Executioner with no face and
The public who fears it
The answer of the questions
The griots that spoke it
The teachings of the old world
Tradition never broken
When they can't see & don't speak
And claim they never heard
For the pain & the pleasure
And the poetry of the words
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Abstract Rude]
Saturation is played
Our maturation and age
Has readied us for the stage
Evacuating the slaves
Half of them underpaid
They're laughing behind your back
Not learning the right training
Walking the wrong track
Talking the rap slang and making contact
With the youth of a like mind
I'm pumping your lifeline
And the saga continues
Just like in a opera Act 1 Scene 2
There's not another you out of all these people
Haiku D'Etat the antagonists' fall
And our rise to glory
Ride through and leave the town void of a viceroy
It's an overthrow when the old one
Ain't governing in fairness
Then guerillas come in rushing him
Get him out of there embarrassed
So unaware and careless
It would lead to his pinch
For with greed they would hoard
And gorge every inch
Besieged by who he befriended close
Or not to be deceived
By who he depended on most
Now that's the question

Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats, I pull it
Bastards ducking when B.I.G. be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking, in my back room fucking
It ain't nothing
They know B.I.G. be handling
With the MAC in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's, oxygen, they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve
Wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q
Forty-five by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like Dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya but I have to
You see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame
And them fucking polka dots

Oh, come, come now, why y'all so dumb now
Hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer sauté, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
""He sounds demented""
Car weed scented, if I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no one
Call me evil, or unbelievable

(""Everybody everywhere is scratching for what they can get
Did you think anybody in this town is any different?
They don't give a damn who gets killed
Just as long as the dice keep rollin
The hoes keep hoeing and the money keeps flowin"")

[Verse]
My name is L, and I'm from a part of town where clowns
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
On 139 and Lenox Ave. there's a big park
And if you're soft, don't go through it when it gets dark
'Cause at nighttime niggas try to tax
They're sneakier than alley cats
That's why I carry gats
Yo, I'm a muthafuckin' fugitive
Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live
Because to me it's all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
We stormed the city, shooting shit up like Frank Nitti
We robbed kids and split the dough 50/50
One day we stuck a dice game on the ave. and split the cash
Then I murdered his ass and took his half
Because I'm all about ends and skins
When you got those, you don't need no muthafuckin' friends
If I catch you on a late night, black, you're getting stuck, jack
My moms told me to get a job, fuck that
Ayo, picture me getting a job
Taking orders from Bob, selling corn on the cob
Yo, how the hell I'mma make ends meet
Making about 120 dollars a week
Man, I'd rather do another hit
I want clean clothes, mean hoes and all that other shit
Yo, I admit, I'm a sucker
A low down, dirty, sneaky, double-crossin' connivin' muthafucka
Breaking in cribs with a crowbar
I wasn't poor, I was po' - I couldn't afford the 'o-r'
I used to wait until it gets dark
And tell a nigga to strip, I wanna see some birthmarks
Like a ninja, dressed in black with a ski mask
I take all the funds, then I run down the street fast
I vicked this nigga named Eugene, took his brand new ring
'Cause sticking up's an everyday routine
Once I was cruising in a beat-up ride
Saw this nigga named Clyde
And snuck up on him from the blind side
I told him, ""Give up the dough, before you get smoked
Oh you're broke? *gunshots*
Now you're dead broke""
The Big L was called crazy
A top-notch crook snatching pocketbooks from old ladies
I don't care, I'll do anything to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck, 'cause I don't give a fuck
Some say I'm ruthless, some say I'm grim
Once a burglar broke into my house and I robbed him
Plenty and many brains I bust
'Cause I was livin' the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous

Sediento va el borracho para llenar su estomago de vino

Y no se vende,como los MC's contaminados de versos, pagados
Y alabado,admirado si al MC respetado de ese solemne griterío
Y no vendido siempre hecho del texto como veis aquí vidente y fuerte
No por matar si no por hacer que muera
Y si mismo el contrario que este siempre a diario
Refleja la pobre cantidad de palabras sabias,altas,para subir la cuesta
Y muestra poca cordura en su mensaje
Y haga su equipaje, huya, huya
Al maestro forma y retorna al pasado
Pocos han quedado a mi lado
Se han cansado de llevar el loro y el parquet
Y asistir a las jams que organiza la peña que manda
Y hace que esto llegue mas lejos de donde esta
Cuando estos lleguen a ancianos si es que llegan
Les tendréis envidia ya que serán y seremos viejos poetas
Considerados y renombrados no como otros que hasta incluso
Hoy han sido olvidados por creer que al igual
Que en otro tipo de movies, llegaría a pasar esto de moda
Y sin tener que ser este una moda va creciendo por toda la terrestre bola

Rap duro,parlante, mamudo, lleno de lírica no desnudo
La mejor forma de clasificarlo es separándolo
Y siendo esto así después ir estudiándolo
No puedes llamar a la tauromaquia deporte, sin embargo
Hay muchos que si lo llaman arte
No importa,no entremos en debate
Lo que hago es como si fuera un bate
Que golpea la pelota fuertemente al otro lado
Donde muy pocos llegan y si llegan es cansados
De forzar su cerebro para abrir su entendimiento
Y así comprender y aprender de mi texto

O músicos en los cuales programando el sampler

Como con la bola en la hierba
Yo soy el amo y tu la sierva
Controlo el micro como Jeru
Y como pierdo el control quemo el bafle

Haciendo la rima en dos filos
Como espada en el esgrima
Y aun con defensa Boneti
Aun para la táctica de esgrima
Levitaras un tuche en el fondo de tu tripa
Y en otro país no hará falta traducirlo
Ya que en su idioma rimara y en español
Podrá decirlo, es la energía que suelta
Te pilla del estomago y por dentro te hace dar la vuelta
Diré una ultima cosa:
A todos a los que empezáis a rimar

Planets be the champ of the amplified sound
Swimmin' in this art born up the boogie down
The Rubin Rod Squad flew angles toward the point
Could a weirdo group of bugs slam a gang of funky joints
The provin’s in the movin' of the baggy clothes
At the dimly lit clubs where flock the milk duds
Hip-hop enzymes with pride kicks inside
Dig the threads

[Verse 2: Butterfly]
The nappy heads
Bobbin' over beats that sleeps with ghetto slang
No sirens just felts and wax from ghetto brains
The cosmic child's hit with dance and beats and kits
Like the punk I don't uhh uhh and shit
The ancestors grin 'cause rap is gettin' fat
To some of them it’s grim 'cause it’s youth be havin' gats
So save all the cares, let down your nappy hairs
'Cause the beats is givin' life like air
The flyest fly bids is swellin' the inside
The locest loc kids left they Glocks in the ride
Hoodlums in the house gettin' they flams on
'Cause even peace got some clout when the funky jams on

[Verse 3: Ladybug]
Insects at the joint no flam just kickin' it
Wiggle with the fruits over by the liquids
The slick kids is down, the flyers passed around
We try to dig the group or recognize the loop
The strobe light is out in the crowd, dig my speakin'
Who you see freakin' is the native cause your seekin'
I came in the door, I said it before
Jams make me kite, if they slam then it’s life remember this

[Verse 4: Doodlebug]
Yo, silkworm’s chillin', Butterfly’s chillin'
A crew of Ladybugs; We giggle with the thugs
The world is in here cause expressions under hair
I love my peers
You for a black jam makes you for a black man
A kid I didn’t know slapped his fingers in my hand
A wisdom caught my eye damn a jams fly
Honeys with some cuties someone havin' hootie

Yo, it's the nightmare before Christmas
Niggas probably ran
I'm hopping out of body bags
I like scaring morticians
Creepy but it's fun though
Chiefing on the skunk dro
By the way, also need some TP for my bunghole
I done stole the spotlight nigga, relax
After the shows you'll have to go home with a nicotine patch
Listeners get straight addicted
Fuck the system we need to rage against it
So I hope this wordplay's convincing
Mad martagon
I role with a gang of midgets
Spitting acidic liquids
Changed to redder shades of litmus
Dangerous mixing fire with gas
Shat on the industry, didn't think of wiping his ass
Keep it funktified
Krunk and lye
Yes, I'm drunk and high true
Nice smooth on the mic but I dance like a white dude
This is handcrafted hip-hop pottery
You're not a Don Juan, nigga
You's a Don Juan wannabe
I'm Sean Connery
Rock a beat like Sisyphus
Reaching in my pockets deep and picking lint
I'm the antithesis of Richie Rich
My car is a mess
Fought so hard to catch this train of thought regardless of stress
The architect, hard to rest
When he's up at night
Puffing pipes
Coming up with rough designs to unplug your mind
From the makeshift matrix
And if you ain't heard of him before
It's about fucking time
[Hook]
'Cuz I'm a nightmare
Your worst nightmare
I'm the reason that you're nervous and you're quite scared
Underneath the fucking surface yo, I'm right there
I'm the reason that you're waking up with white hairs
I'm a nightmare
Your worst nightmare
You can kiss my ass cheeks I got a nice pair
And I don't need a lot of muscle I don't fight fair
Phillip Morris got the hustle on the mic, yeah

[Verse 2: Phillip Morris]
I'll beat a bad kids ass
Trip them while their parents ain't looking
That'll give them ample time to marinate
I serenade careless dates with skin-flute solos
Chase around the room in a thin blue kimono
That's what happens when you mix pimp juice and NoDoz
Hit Myspace and post the improved photos
Homegrown herbs got my higher than Kid Icarus
Talk out the side of my mouth like aspiring ventriloquist
This is not a warning
I'm worse than Chewbacca storming down your block
At 2 o'clock in the morning, hard to ignore me
Thanks to the dishonorable George B
I can subject you to water boarding
Until you're screaming ""Stop it no more please!""
Straight to the psych-ward after this hospital quarantine
Popping Thorazine smelling like hot garbage and corned beef
He's a clever dude, tied his sheets together quick
Beat the sedatives and climbed outside to preach the rhetoric
My bloodstream contains high levels of mescaline plus
Hunter S. Thompson specter is resting in my chest, yes
Hip-hop journalism gets injected with a fresh syringe
Psycho-analysts are like, ""It's evident Tourettes exists.""
A pestilence in the form of this fresh cadence
You ain't seen the level of horror since Wes Craven
I'm the cause of your heavy breathing
And if you're starting to feel tense, because you've got every reason

And call me like Tyrone

Told her the feelings golden
Hitting notes like she Jill
Kissing my baby face

[Intro]
Uh, going out to the Zulu Nation

[Verse 1]
You go out with the old and in with the new
I'm well-situated cause I know what to do
When the mic is in my hand see I just stand firm
And wreck shit so the next man learns
How do you flow? I never run out of breath
So much sould I had to step to the left
Because my style's Abstract
See I form no definite picture but I get you anyway
And I like to say
You can play King Erisson and have a nice day
I go on and on like inflation
Yeah, I shoot the gift on your radio station
I walk around uptown with my Dalmation
And when he's hungry he eats Kennel Rations
Huh, I give good vibrations
From the Rockies to the Appalachians
Hit skins across the nation
But I won't budge if she's on her menstration
Yeah, I won't swim in the red sea
Even if it's so Betsy
Rode more saddles than Willie Shoemaker
It doesn't take Diamond all day to make a
Hype slammin track, but I won't never rush
The proof is in the pudding so hush
[Verse 2]
Well don't smirk up your lips, where'd you get the audacity?
Give me five minutes and I'll show you how it has to be
Done, don't front, you're not the first or the last to be
Warned of the skills I possess the capacity
I catch wreck just like Butch Cassidy
So don't sleep, money grip, or that ass'll be
Out of the frying pan, into the fire
Now I'm dead on your ass like Spencer for Hire
Word, but I'm not on the take
Brothers start to shake when I dig in the crates
And create a hype plate that rotates
On 33, with the flavor of a ho cake
Yeah, I keep ticking like a Timex
I go the whole nine, so if you reach a climax
Blame it on the boogie, blame it on the rhythm
Blame it on the vibe that I give 'em

[Verse 3]
Yo, I used to smoke Newports, never toked on a Marlboro
See I'm from the Boogie and I'm proud, 'cause our borough
Was the first to take a five-second beat
Make it repeat, then it spread across the tri-borough
Living lovely, everything's teriffic
I get wicked just like Wilson Pickett
So come again, come again my friend
If you live by the pen then you'll die by the pen
I'm gonna live to be a senior citizen
Why? Because my shit is in
So come along on my musical journey
You don't need a ticket, 'cause Diamond can kick it
Like Pele, way back in his heyday
Going out to Butterball and my cousin Ray Ray
Never did a bid, but I almost did
I use my head cause I'm one smart kid
I don't own a Rolex but I absorb beats like a Kotex
And get funky just like Joe Tex
Word, see my rhymes make your brain tick
Brothers bump my tape because it's not the same shit
That you heard last year or the past year
I ring bells at the cashier
'Cause I'm a fun going guy with the notty dreadlocks
I once lost a bill betting on the Red Sox
But that's another topic, I used to cut rocket in the pocket
Three minutes and change, I'd better stop it

And I gotta give a shout out to G-Man, and Joe Control

third world,try jah love,1993,"Try Jah Love LyricsA lonely soul, was I without direction
I didn't know which way that I had to go
I sought the clues, to life's unanswered questions
My mind's heart had to know

I heard you call
While wandering through the darkness
I'd walk a million miles to find that endless voice
That speaks to me when I am in temptation
Echoing my choice..
Then He said, ""Seek ye shall find
I've been with you through all time""

And if you're thirsty
I will quench you with my love
And if you're hungry
I will feed you with my word
And all I ask of you is that you love, as I do..

And if you lose your way
I'll lead you to my love
From a sinful life
I'll cleanse you in my love
For creation bears a witness, of my love..

You know that
You should know it's time for the world to (try Jah love)
The only love that can bring peace is (Jah Jah love)
So won't you try, try, try, try, try

A timeless thought, a touch of close encounter
Your love embraced me and took over my life
And now I'm new, your strength has made me
Change my ways from wrong to right
Please Father please, this world we live has faltered
Deliver us from all this evil and pain
God bless the heart, that loves unto his brother
Praising out Your name..

Then He said, ""Be not afraid
Those who believe I will save""

""See, I think drugs have done some good things for us, I really do. And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, do me a favor - go home tonight and take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your CDs and burn 'em. 'Cause you know what? The musicians who've made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years... real fucking high on drugs.""

""Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.""
""It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom, that's what it is, okay? Keep that in mind at all times, thank you.""

[Verse 1]
Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes
[Verse 2]
On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again (And back again)
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye

[Refrain]
In, out, in, out, in, out

[Verse 3]
A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question
To find I've known this all along

[Chorus]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running?

[Verse 4]
Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into the shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song
[Chorus]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?

[Refrain]
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye

[Chorus]
So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing the tail of dogma

[Refrain]
I opened my eye, I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were
I opened my eye, I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were
[Chorus]
So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing a trail of smoke and reason

[Verse 1: Everlast]
Ya see I'm Irish, but I'm not a leprechaun
You wanna fight, then step up and we'll get it on
You'll get a right to the grill, I'm white and I ill
A decendant of Dublin with titanic skill
I ducked and I swing, next thing your jaw's broken
Punk I ain't jokin', you can bet you'll be chokin'
On a fist full of nuttin, meanwhile I'll be puffin'
On a fat blunt, what punk? You don't know the half
Tryin' to talk shit, man, please don't make me laugh
These Irish eyes are smilin', I'm buckwhylin'
The House of Pain is pumpin', start jumpin'
Freak it, funk it, back seat trunk it
If you can't get with it, you'll wind up sweatin' it
Then you'll get a beatin' just like an egg
It's so hard to run when you got a broken leg
But we can have a run off, the House of Pain'll come off
We got the cake that you're tryin to get a crumb off
The Irish stylee, the Celtic jazz
No one has it, just us, that's it
If you try to take it, I got a big shillelagh
I don't have dreads cause I shave my head daily
You call me a skinhead, I call you a pin head
Yo, where you been man, just like the Tin Man
You got no heart, here comes the good part
I pick 'em, buck 'em, cut 'em up, and buck 'em down
No fuckin' around, homeboy ya get clowned like Krusty
Trust me, you shouldn't play.. and by the way

[Verse 2: Everlast]
Greetings, salutations
Peace to the Nations of Zulu and Islam
Crack a bottle, rev the throttle
Put the gear in, now you're steerin'
Like Mario Andretti, so let me kick it
Cause I can make a wicked noise like a cricket
Rubbin' his legs, my rhymes are like eggs
Allah'll keep layin' em, I'll keep sayin' em
This is the House of Pain, we're far from plain
But we're not fancy, Ron and Nancy
So ""Just Say No,"" but I say go
Straight to Hell, I kiss and tell
So if you're a ho, all my friends know
What you gotta say? Let's hit the hay
And have no delay, and yo, by the way..

How could ya doubt it? Now scream and shout it!
The House of Pain, soon will reign
Over the Hip-Hop scene in white gold and green

I rip shit and backflip like a Jedi
I roll with the groove and I'm smooth and you can bet I
Come correct and get respect when I'm flowin'
Collectin' my dough, I got you're girlfriend hoein
And how do I know that she's sprung?
I know she's sprung cause yo, the D's hung.. like a
Shetland pony, gettin' paid like Sony
So never ever try to play me out like a phony
Cause I can get real thick like a bowl of Malt-O-Meal

So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me
(Rock the house, rock the house, rock the house)

Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood
[Verse 1]
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred
I'm a veteran, which means that I've been
In the game too long, since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I flow like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Spectacular over M-I-C
I go for broke, never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request
You like the rhyme, bite if you dare
I get the paper so I don't care
Fly that's me; the epitomy
Of what a real MC is supposed to be
Fucking you up every time that I drop
I fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look, it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
It's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun
If you don't understand then say you don't (nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best (say what?)
West to East, see East to West
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive
Cause it's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics
I got many witnesses that can back this
Ruffnecks, from New York to L.A
Been down with me since Poor George
It's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
Make the ill type moves, I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I
[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Get out my shit, please let me be
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that
Trying to get over like a fat rat
But I understand I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop
It goes on, on, on, on
You see, the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver
Chilling with
A pina colada, kidada hooked me up
With Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere, that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you?
You better get down with your real crew
'Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Never judge a book by the cover
Discover the soul brother with the Mecca don
Working brunette to blonde
How many Edison con when I respond in full black
With us having the vernon villains back-to-back
Amazing grace when I face the great paper chase
For real it’s long overdue
So I don’t wanna talk to you
I stroke the hell out of mademoiselle who insisted
Every night, she get her back twisted in the unlisted
I’m living through my son so daddy see it this way
I want him in the NFL, his brother in the NBA
No doubt I'm with a piece, down in mecca, all crazy
To the late Eve, none of this is make-believe
I breathe some of the most powerful lyrics of our century
Battle physically, conquer mentally
Essentially, you’re dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go y’know, I’ll take you there

You know you can make me move
Over, over again
Come on and take me there

Control now so in the future see me calling the shots
From larger plots to cash to mini-bikes and open mics
I’m blowing up spots for knots in the millennium years
And now I drop it on my peers, brings tears and fears
And now the question manifest in my only
My soldiers wear Versace or the army fatigue
That brings a world of intrigue and glamour to my arsenal
Of dons, pimps to players and layers of decepticons
My whole mind-state gravitate to weapon
Making people in the business get a misconception
It ain’t hard to the core, it ain’t sex on the beach
It’s just another plateau the brothers have to reach
Emphatic with non-cypher, then we were broke and misguided
Try to gas me like Hitler once we get divided
No question, you’re dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go, I’ll take you there

When brothers try to count all my chips in the game
Now let me civilize your foolish acts of gunplay

Chose for negroes, the most hypnotical flows
On the planet, another East Coast track rose, goddammit
My theme, to mainstream’s the knocker
Only time I get writer's block is when my lucci's on lock
Pretty much I’m coming through in the clutch see
My thought is a bombshell, built to only propel
Or is it just my style of hustle making a mark
To rumble the playgrounds with more danger than Jurassic Park
It was dark, when I brought it to the light, for spite
My staff’s got me taking nothing but champagne baths
Now the aftermath’s dealing with a Mecca affair

Like that sellout, not callin' no names
But really, ""who's bad""
I go through obstacles like a whole box of condoms
You can't forget where you come from
[T-Boz]
Take a good look in the mirror
And tell me, do you like what you see
Masters of deception, corruption and evil
But you're always quick to point the finger at me
Won't somebody tell me

[Chorus]
I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
What gave you the right to misjudge me
And write me off on the wall
Acting as if you understand me
In reality, you just don't know me at all

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
Sometimes I can't help but wonder
If this was how it's meant to be
But if you search deep enough in your soul
You'll always find a slight reminder of me
Won't somebody tell me
[Chorus]
I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
A-yo, if we could all agree
To lettin' our souls become free
Of that sweet bitterness
Then who's chest would have the most seeds?
I keep misfocusin' my needs
And this stress on my back
With them gats they be blastin' into my knapsack
Ain't no accidental deathtraps
My mishap is the fact that I'm destined to snap (Yeah)
It's when I feel as though my body's able to go
My mind is ready to flow
Did you know first you catch and then I throw
It's my own sense of time
If I'm late, it's cause I'm endin' my day
Just when the sun shines
And still gently advising the arisin' of the moon
As it roams around into my soundproof dimension
[Chorus (T-Boz)]
I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday (Oh yeah)

I just don't understand
The ways of the world today
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing to live for (Hey)
So I'm longing for the days of yesterday

Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next, for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory

[Pre-Chorus]

You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it, read it
And you don't have to eat it, eat it
To buy it is to feed it, feed it
Then why do we keep fooling ourselves?

They say he's homosexual

In the hood, frame him if you could
Shoot to kill, to blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses, damn self-righteousness
In the black, stab me in the back
In the face, to lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of all your glory

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
He was raised up in Nazareth and raised on the thizzerd
Never got drunk, got high, or sipped sizzurp
Prophesied King, Isaiah 9, that's the wizzerd
He's the real king, and it don't matter what you hizzerd
A king's a real shepherd dawg
Acts in peoples' favor ya'll
Not a self seekin' player all about the paper dawg
Call 'em the Messiah, the Annointed One the Savior
Caught Him on the humble but you'll see Him reign later
These self-proclaimed kings braggin' cause they on chrome
But twenty-six inches is a pretty low throne
Like kids playin' in they daddy's clothes when he's gone
The clothes don't fit and daddy's comin' back home
Really this is foolish mane
You don't wanna do this mane
The King of kings is comin' back
The theocratic ruler mane
What if you should pass away and see Him on the last of days
There ain't no making deals so really what is there you have to say

Oh how excellent is his essence we reverence His name
While silly peasants we presently tryna steal His fame
You carry .45s, AKs, king of the tools
But you can't make a day
You can't take away from the King of the Jews
See what about the major day
When you face to face with yes you know who
We wanna be a king with bling and do major things
But He supremely rules
You must be jokin', you smokin', plus you buyin' that Buddha
Why defy him when you can rely on the Lion of Judah?
Supreme ruler shinin' brighter than Jacob the jeweler's
Jewelry, cause it's true indeed he's savin' us through the
Cross of Christ and that's true
Follow him lose ya life and that's true
Gain new life, ya got to let loose
Of your own throne and follow Jesus
Rollin' big whips don't make you no king
Rollin' them spliffs don't make you no king
Pretty mixed screens don't make you no king
Smokin' those ki's don't make you no king
See you can run a trap own a house and smoke black and milds
You'll be a king when you can do things like roll back the clouds

You see, I skip to my lou like Napoleon at Waterloo
My name is Diamond D, tell you what I'm gonna do
I dip and I dab like a Mike Tyson jab
Even though there's flab, I possess the gift of gab
I shoot it like a jammy and girls give the panties and
Even with a fanny and I might win a Grammy and
Maybe I won't, so I'll chill like the Pope
See, I'll never mope 'cause I know my shit is dope
Like Colombian fish scale, ask my man Ishmael
(Diamond D got props like a cop)
Or better yet DT 'cause brothers can't see me
Even your girl says you got a small wee wee
Now you wanna go upside her head
Do you feel intimidated by the things she said?
Don't be mad 'cause I paid her back
(You know I) took her to the rest and I laid her back
(I go) on and on like popcorn with the butter
A-a-a-a-yo! I used to stutter
But I fall on track and some may say I'm wack and
Fat, but in fact, I'm not any of that, black
See, I'm the best kept secret (Yeah)
So shut the fuck up and peep it
[Hook x4]
""Diamond D""... ""Raised in Forest""
""Rapper tries to diss, I crush the motherfucker""

[Verse 2]
See, I write my own rhymes, produce my own shit
Yeah boy, I ain't the one to fuck with (Nope)
I'll take a beat and I'll flip it
With so much flavor, niggas wanna sip it
But that's cool 'cause they know I got skills
Let me demonstrate if you will, ahem
Rock is my man and so is Dapper Dan and
I'll shake your hand and don't try to flam
Or front like a stunt who lost her cunt
I only hit grand slams, never will I bunt
Bases are loaded, bottom of the ninth
I step to the plate 'cause I know my shit is great
I can't walk down the street
(A-yo Diamond, can you make me a beat?)
You gotta have cheese, about a couple of G's
But if I know ya, I might just throw ya
A little somethin' on the side, troop
A funky bassline and a hype loop
I got a thousand old records in my crib
I used to hustle but I never did a bid
Some people call me Jo Jo, I keep a low pro
Non-stop props, so act like you know, bro
Pass me a mic and I'mma keep it
Yeah boy, I'm the best kept secret
[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I'm deadlier than Michael Myers
My style will embrace you like a pair of pliers
But don't sweat it, G, why don't you let it be?
'Cause Diamond D is a pedigree
In other words, I'm official
I'll never go out like a wet piece of tissue
Ruff and rugged, stronger than Bounty
New York is the city, Bronx is the county
Learned from the best so the rest just fess
Now I'm gettin' booked at the Fillmore West
Located in the Village, so kill it, 'skillet
You ask yourself, will it ever cease?
'Cause Diamond's sharp as a crease
I only use bees wax, I'll never use grease on my dreads
But instead, if you want some kicks
Step to the mic, I'm an 8 to 1 pick
You reap what you sow and I can reap it
Yo, I'm the best kept secret

""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""

[Verse 1]
No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under their noses
I hate those motherfuckin' posers
But I'm so real to them it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal
[Hook]
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""

[Verse 2]
Oh yes, I'm greater than all MC's when I breeze
Give me room, please
I be like fascinatin' when I be updatin'
Cuttin' off wack kids, pullin' their trump cards
I thump hard, and make 'em say that I'm God
Niggas be pretendin' they're hardcore
Never know the meanin' of (raw)
But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
No double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, 'cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
'Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
'Cause suckers be like playin' themselves to have mass appeal

""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
[Verse 3]
I know I'm dope, but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks, but now I'm makin' greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks, I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore, I'm calm but wild
With my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you it's tragic, I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya
Those who kick dirt, in due time I'm gonna get ya
'Cause I be kickin' the real
While they be losin' the race tryin' to chase mass appeal

Brace yourself for the awesome and rare
The real, the right dynamite is in the atmosphere
As there's a time and place for everything that's under the sun
This is the time and the place that we have some fun
Now take a see to check the pedigree
Of the band that's spelled S-T-E-T
The rhymerator, Dee-Lite, the R-O-D
And on the keys, my brother D-B-C
Wise, Frukwan and my DJ Paul
We puttin' competition back, up against the back of the wall
Me and the band that I just mention
Present to you a new invention

We-we-we-we regulate a Stets-a-flucture
So def, a listen to the structure
Formulate ya own, but please don't touch a
Good lookin' out, we thank ya very much a
Heed this style on the cartwheel nightcha
Fight to the end, I bet we'll bust ya up
And ya welcome to a force that creeps
Slowly but surely, enough we'll defeat you, BREAK!

Straight to the letter witta hip-hop band
Of America, London and even Japan
And you surely will admit by bein a fan
Nobody else does it like we can
To battle us is truly a gamble
Excellence is proven by example
The ladies smile while the bodies are in shamble
Back off Puba, this ya can't handle
The rhythm homeboy is definitely ringin'
The beats and rhymes are the chords that are tinglin'
So grab your girl, let's start the jam
For at the helm is a band who's in demand, BREAK!

And a rhyme that's equipped as a barricade
Cool and clever, crack I never
Wit my crew I will never sever

That is the place we always go down
And every night a party goes down
And when it starts, it never slows down
We boogie to the DJ's non-stop
To the sound of the Brooklyn hip-hop
And if you've ever seen Brooklyn rock

Stands out like a winner at'cha favorite tune
All tension is released upon the call of the beat
As you rock along to a funky treat
Like a torch, we're keepin' you active
Our rhythm will hold you captive
We're perfecters of the poem we sing
Marketing to the top with the style's that's addicting
No doubt, about what we capture
A-nother classical treasure
So productive and effective
Chuck it out as a jam that's spreading

Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot

Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side

Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy

You know the style, Tip, it's time to flip this

Steady eating booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case, I own more condoms than T.L.C
Now the formula is this: Me, Tip, and Ali
For those who can't count, it goes 1-2-3

Brothers find this hard to do but never me
Some brothers try to diss but Malik, you see 'em bitching
Me no care about them dibby MC, my shit is hitting
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada

lil' kim,not tonight,1996,"Not Tonight Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Rémy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it
Felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to, pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the Jeep
Tell him, ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, ho hop
Raw top in my man's drop
Then this homie Jimmy, he's screamin', ""Gimme""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Called suckin' his dick, ""rockin' the mic""
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy
[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

[Verse 2]
I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush & Avenue U
Had a weed spot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't tap
I used to see him, in The Tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four-stroke creep
I jumped on the dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin'""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
""I'll pass, nigga, the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double glass
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown, taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your 5 G stones
I give you 10 G's, nigga, if ya leave me alone,"" screamin'
[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right

[Verse 3]
The moral of the story is this:
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double-digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front
For limp-dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

Look up, what do you see? All of you and all of me
Fluorescent and starry, some of them, they surprise
The bus ride, I went to write this, 4 AM, this letter
Fields of poppies, little pearls, all the boys and all the girls
Sweet-toothed, each and every one a little scary
I said your name, I wore it like a badge of teenage film stars
Hash bars, cherry mash and tinfoil tiaras
Dreaming of Maria Callas, whoever she is
This fame thing, I don't get it
I wrap my hand in plastic to try to look through it
Maybelline eyes and girl-as-boy moves
It can take you far, this star thing, I don't get it

It tastes like fear
I'll take you over

Will you live to 83?
Will you ever welcome me?
Will you show me something that nobody else has seen?
Smoke it, drink, here comes the flood
Anything to thin the blood
These corrosives do their magic slowly and sweet
Phone, eat it, drink, just another chink
Cuts and dents, they catch the light
Aluminum, the weakest link
I don't wanna disappoint you, I'm not here to anoint you
I would lick your feet, but is that the sickest move?
I wear my own crown of sadness and sorrow
And who'd have thought tomorrow would be so strange?
My loss, and here we go again

Look up, and what do you see?
All of you and all of me, fluorescent and starry
And some of them, they surprise

The sweat, the victory and sorrow, the smell of fear
I got it

When I fill my pockets with a knot of dollar bills
Sipping pints of ale out the window sill
When I get my fill, I'm chilly-chill

What's the time? It's time to buy ale
Peter eater, parking meter, all of the time
If I run out of ale, it's Thunderbird wine

Get down with Mike D, and it ain't no hassle

rage against the machine,take the power back,1992,"Take the Power Back Lyrics[Intro]
Crank the music up
Bring that shit in, uh
Yeah, the movement's in motion with massive militant poetry
Now check this out, uh

[Verse 1]
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back
[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

[Verse 2]
The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

[Interlude 1]
Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
Break it, break it down, aw shit

[Interlude 2]
And like this
Uh! Come on
Yeah, bring it back the other way
Uh

[Verse 3]
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' Weathermen)
Expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back

Back to the woods for that fresh parley
Maybe even spark a little Nicky J
And then it's off to Center City in the fastest way

Then the only way to go is I-76
Unless of course you wanna take that scenic view
Then the east or west river drive is right for you
But if you ain't gotta anytime to lose

And get on down to I-76

So get to Fishtown without all that jive

Beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me
And loving me tonight
Somewhere out there
Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that great somewhere out there

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullabye
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky

If love can see us through
Then we'll be together

And then suddenly you'll find Never Never Land

And thought of all the money I'd wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I'd spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
Said to myself this ain't gonna be so tough
With that little bit of assurance
I took another puff
I took a puff, a puff, then I ripped off another puff
I decided I'd about had about enough
That breaking this habit won't be too tough

Now I've give a lot of thought to this thing
If I didn't smoke cigarettes I'd feel just like a king
Besides with the price going up every day
I knew I was just throwing all my good money away
You know I ain't lit one in an hour or so?
Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know
I was thinking maybe I oughta write all this down
Put it in a song kinda circulate it around
Can't ever tell it might make a hit
And that redneck Hall did a little bit
Can you imagine me a hit songwriter!
Now where's... Where'd I put that cigarette lighter?
After all it's a habit and a habit you can break
Just a little bit of willpower son that's all it takes
I said to myself you got to be tough!
And with that little bit of wisdom
I took another puff

I took a puff, and then a puff, then I finally ripped off another puff
And I decided boy this ain't gonna be tough
Besides I'd just about had enough
I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway
Oh I think they ought to take it offa television
It looks too good! Ow!
I like them skinny ones with the filter
Oh give it to me! Give it to me!
Cigarettes... I say if I quit smoking what'll I do?
Maybe I'll eat
Yeah I'll eat cigarettes
Ahh, I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it
Chester B don't smoke, he smokes logs!
Makes you laugh funny too
Oh my throat's scratchin', oh
I wish I could think of something bad to say about cigarettes
Boo on cigarettes, don't smoke don't smoke don't smoke
You quit smoking that'll leave more for me!
I love it I love it, no I don't love cigarettes ya know
Don't misunderstand me I hate cigarettes
Makes ya cough, and when ya don't smoke it makes ya shake
I don't know what's worse, the shake or the cough
I think I'll make me a coughshake, oh!
Son did you ever smoke?
Oh I remember one time I quit smoking
I quit for three months
My wife left me
So did my children
She took my house and left

blues traveler,whoops,1993,"Whoops LyricsHave you ever seen an atom?
Little bits of everything floating by
Take a good look at them
Collectively they compose all you see including your eye

Brilliant puzzle
A living Rubix Cube we think we can figure out and solve
But we're just monkeys
Scratching our heads trying to open our ears
To a chord that just don't seem to resolve
And we call it wisdom
Yes, intellect in a truest sense of the word
You see for us security means a harmony
According to only what we have heard
And this along and nothing less
Will ease our heart and our mind
In the hope that in feeling free we'll reach paradise
On that hilltop we're still trying to find

But the possibility exists no matter how scary it may seem
That paradise was once the world and it wasn't just a dream
The earth was our heaven and we did not know there were rules for us to break
And maybe now we'll find out too late what a clever hell we can make

Whoops
Whoops
Whoops
Whoops

In this corner
Weighing in at almost every weight imaginable
Life and all that surrounds it
And in this corner
Weighing in at well, not really much of anything
A very sound and user friendly idea
On finally bringing that pesky mountain to Mohammed
Gentlemen at the sound of the harmonica solo you may come out fighting
Take a look at the horizon
Quiet and still
You know there used to be bison
Gentlemen you may fire at will
They say this land won't go to waste
But you gotta wonder how
You know we're chopping down the air we breathe
As fodder for the cow

That's right so we can eat well
Yes and starve to death
And say there's nothing we can do
Because we really don't want to do a goddamn thing
Look I'm shrugging and so are you
We can imagine the straightest of lines
But our fingers can't control the pen
And it's this frustration that yields relief
As we say we're just mortal men
And that means we get to torture a chimpanzee
And infect him with disease
Because he screams just like a human child
While we study his desperate pleas

But the possibility exists no matter how scary it may seem
That paradise was once the world and it wasn't just a dream
The earth was our heaven and we did not know there were rules for us to break
And maybe now we'll find out too late what a clever hell we can make
Whoops
Whoops

While we're on the subject you know my conscience hurts
And it will not go away
So please concoct me some pill I can take
While I think of something clever to say
So I can look in my mirror made of polished glass
And find no need to cringe
And forget that sinking feeling, I'm a dinosaur
Out on his drunken last binge

From fossil to fossil
Dust to dust
I'll see you all in the earthy crust

Ah, nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?

[Verse: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell (What you talkin' 'bout, man?)
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies (Aw, man)
God'll probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse (Ah)
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (Yo, get a hold of yourself, nigga)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder; if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies (You're buggin', B)
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit (Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red (It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe (Ayo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
Nigga, talk to me please, man!
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Ayo, ayo, man, I'm out)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street? (I'ma call you when I get in the car)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin' (Cut that), I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (Ayo)

""From whence shall we expect the approach of danger? Shall some transatlantic giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe and Asia could not, by force, take a drink from the Ohio River or set a track on the Blue Ridge in the trial of a thousand years. If destruction be our lot, we ourselves must be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men, we will live forever, or die by suicide.""
[Verse 1: Patrick Stickles]
There'll be no more counting the cars on the Garden State Parkway
Nor waiting for the Fung Wah bus to carry me to who-knows-where
And when I stand tonight, 'neath the lights of the Fenway
Will I not yell like hell for the glory of the Newark Bears?
Because where I'm going to now, no one can ever hurt me
Where the well of human hatred is shallow and dry
No, I never wanted to change the world, but I'm looking for a new New Jersey
Because tramps like us, baby, we were born to die
[Verse 2: Patrick Stickles]
I'm doing 70 on 17, I'm doing 80 over 84
And I never let the Meritt Parkway magnetize me no more
Give me a brutal Somerville summer
Give me a cruel New England winter
Give me the great Pine Barrens
So I can see them turned into splinters
And if I come in on a donkey, let me go out on a gurney
I want to realize too late I never should have left New Jersey

I sense the enemy, they're rustling around in the trees
I thought I had gotten away but the followed me to 02143
Oh, woe, woe is me, no one knows the trouble I see
When they hang Jeff Davis from a sourapple tree, I'll sit beneath the leaves and weep
None of us shall be saved, every man will be a slave
For John Brown's body lies a-mould'ring in the grave and there's rumbling down in the caves
So if it's time for choosing sides, and to show this dirty city how we do the Jersey Slide
And if it deserves a better class of criminal
Then I'ma give it to them tonight
So we'll rally around the flag, rally around the flag
Rally around the flag, boys, rally once again
Shouting the Battle Cry of Freedom
Rally around the flag, rally around the flag
Glory, glory, Hallelujah, His truth is marching on

Cynical motha fuckin' bureaucrats
And other kinda ding bats
Livin on the tracks
The tracks in my arm said
It all depends which side the tracks your on
Tellin' me what to wear
Tellin me cut my hair
And tryin to convince me that they
Really really care
All about my health and about my wealth
But still they built the Stealth
Cause everybody's
Just lookin out for they self

Can I have a clean needle

A deal we can score ya
On a bed for a night or two
Or three or four months

Is fightin' for political
But if your analytical
You know it's much more critical than that

Can I kick a few facts yes?

Six percent in college
From livin on the block
Twenty five percent in prison
The school of hard knocks
Fifty percent in poverty
Is livin on the rocks
Five hundred brothas on a death row box

The punishment is capital
For those who lack in capital
Because a public defender
Can't remember the last time
That a brother wasn't treated like an animal
They say they blame it on a song
When someone kills a cop
What music did they listen to
When they bombed Iraq?
Give me one example so I can take a sample
No need to play it backwards
If you wanna hear the devil
Cause music's not the problem
It didn't cause the bombin'
But maybe they should listen
To the songs of people starving..

I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense

""Resurrection""

[Verse 2]
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo) I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruise the Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
When it's my turn to go, I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm

Who keeps it methods unorthodox, who caught the props
Who's styles are shit, who's gonna rock?
On to the break of dawn, you wanna battle, pay the price
I'm mathematically precise, smooth and plus nice
With a flow that's like a mailman or letter carrier
Rob-O brings the ghetto area
Funk flavor through your neighborhood, state, town, or borough
Straight down, I don't fake I'm quite thorough
Not your average rapper (Listen)
Cause in a sec I write some shit to blast your wack ass to Mecca
See Rob's the most Mecca
To grab the microphone and yes y'all it
To school these dreds and stress these bald heads
That INI's in the house (You don't stop)
With Grap Luva, Marco Polo, Ras you don't stop
We let the funk slide and let God be our guide
Flowing from the Vernon worldwide
[Pete Rock]
It's the funk god, taking you worldwide, so bust it
Flowing over beats cause it's a must, kid
That I proceed to fix the hardcore in the mix
Check one two with the flow that fits
I make the hits that soar, I put the wreck in the raw
'94 in your local record store
It's Pete Rock and CL, the Main Ingredient
Now leave your wack style home, cause you won't be needing it
I grab the mic and get wreck for real
You hear me on the wax, kid, you see me on the steel
Can you feel the funk as I inject it?
Then God protect it, hold the mic, see I select it
To keep it crazy versatile
But still underground, packs the four pound cause it's wild
In this place you'll find it hard to hide
Soul Brother and I'm going worldwide

[Rob-O]
Now who's the greatest? Few debate this, you're still figuring?
Well perish the thought, there's none bigger in
This act son, Mecca is all I attract
You're wack, son, yeah your talent's a fraction
While I'm nice, as Christ, is to religion
So envision a messiah on a mission, the competition
I'll stop your wishing point blank cause you lost it
Your joint sank, your soft style's exhausted
And now it's mandatory, you stand before me amazed and awed
Giving praise, yeah to God
Rob cipher's born, most Mecca supreme
A fly MC with the self-esteem
You keep it wholesome and still I relax a bit
I played your shit out, now get out, cause my wig out has to hit
Steadily encouraging head bops while you're scurrying to get props
I'm worldwide
[Pete Rock]
Yo, check out the rhyme buster, pulling niggas through the wringer
I'm not a singer, as I conduct with one finger
It's the orchestrater, mutilator, master funktator
I've got mad flow from here to Asia
Cause I'll amaze ya with the skills that I possess
Not categorized with all the rest

Air soul kicks and crushed velvet hats
Hanging off the ave with the beautifulest naps
Ride in the crest with the blessed, give a yes
Planets kinda funky, as if you hadn't guessed
Placebos getting blocked, funky joints get rocked
Jive is not found
We fly from the flesh
Whether Jeep or Lac
Peak you as you been there and float to them raps
Butterfly's planets for the jam 8 Tracks
From the 90-tops with the twists and plaits
Look beneath my hat
Find the braids that hit ya, metro quite equipped
Knows of all the funk that was laid in seven zips
Funk is phat, homey homey don't you know me
Cool is back, give some skin, lay it on me
Groovy you could call it

Slick just like a lizard
Really weird, or is it
It's just the logic, from how we rocks it
Pop shock picks it up and drops its
We, the synthesis of then and now melts
Channeled to the masses by a DJ and some felts
Long haired hippies, Afro blacks
All get together across the tracks
Because when we shows up, rhythm rolls up

Life ain't what it seems, life is but a dream

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
Welcome to the zone where the strong only survive
The places I drive? all the gangsters can't stay alive
Take my universal journey through the jungles of the hardest town
Where my brothers lay their life down
You want something to play with?
Go find yourself some toys, when you mistake these grown men for little boys
More real than what is real, so feel 'em sending
Compare the God with no beginning and we'll have no ending
My blessed rings are down with the king's revelation
Had heard me on the Run-DMC's reincarnation
Child abuse, women loose, robbery and triple homicide
Everywhere this black man resides still
Check the monologue, I'm off for 6 a.m. jog
To regain my powers, do a set before the showers
I'm prime for the summertime, the big time bowler
But any season, no reason we can't take it over

Are you ready for the legendary crazy rugged rated raw
Known to be the smooth who sat by the door
Furthermore, for you and I to click, here's the stats
Take all that dirty money, set the pot stores and laundry mats
You love to gamble now we open up an after-hours spot
20 sacks with the Guinness for the jackpot
Members only, playing pool like Willie Mosconi
With a tenderoni chatting about the GS I'm batting
I'm patting down with the sound of a general
Fully supplied by my ghettofied residential
We come to rebuild and turn off the heat now
Hoping we can take it back to Huguenot Street
Palled around the screen TV watching the fight
Tonight, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right
Ink tents in all of my circumference I connect
Now demanding all types of respect, can you dig it?

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Travelling the warp speed we come to the peak
Like a missile I probe and seek, many can't critique
My physique is still solid, chiseled down to the very last compound
I'm trying that chin, fool, where you been?
Still sliding girls in soon as pops fall asleep
His game tight, set to flip a shorty late night
I like rocks and rubies, condo shows and cuties
The hottest cars and the strongest drinks at the bars
This is one of those joints that make you stand by the exits
Cause every time I'm yapping something crazy happens
Keep my tool in my baggy jeans rolling with sneaker fiends
Who got a life term working for the firm
My labor's fruit off of business as usual
Plus my two clan band is making me a wealthy man
Now from where I stand, believe it's not a game

The Hand of The Master of Ceremonies grabs a hold of me
His Spirit grabs a hold of my soul
He's in control
I feel His breath in my chest, giving life and killing
The mesh is my flesh which has been torn like a curtain
He speaks through the speakers to lost souls who are hurtin'
I'm cordless but still connected and that's for certain
He graces life's stage though to some He's invisible
Like I said before sometimes He gets lyrical
Rhymes with signs and miracles of Him it is typical
How we need for Him to speak, situation is critical
Sometimes I'm not correct and need some mic checks
Check 1, 2 He keeps my soul in tune
The greatest feeling is when I feel the vibrations
Of His voice echoing revealing revelations (whoa!)
Hold me tight and let me feel You flow
It's when I feel most alive
And my soul brightly glows

[Verse 2]
At times I lie quiet, waiting for Your call
To You I yield my all, You are my all in all
My choice is that, I will echo only Your voice
And see that it's not me but the people that give You feedback
When You speak, it's fluent, eloquent and excellent
Bringing faith which is the evidence of Your presence
Sometimes Your words fall on ears that are deaf
Which lead feet on false paths heading straight for death
I can't wait, I eagerly anticipate
When Your hand reaches for me and my spirit levitates
And then I fulfill the purpose for which I was made
To express Your glory and cover the earth with it like waves
So that under the influence of Your magnificence
All those on Your wavelength will respond in resonance
I feel Your hand again, my soul feels such joy
Your voice like many waters, oh what a joyful awesome noise

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I see my peers being used and abused
They sound distorted giving out messages confused
They are held with a different hand, gripped with a different spirit
Spitting out death defying but death giving lyrics
Negative in content with misguided intent
Claim to say what they mean, and mean what they meant
Though with mics connected souls are disconnected
From the true Source, no new force
The Highest G in due course of course
They may choose not to be held
In tight grips in who's lips Truth is withheld
And be an instrument that is instrumental
And fundamental not speaking things detrimental
How many mics are misused on the daily
To spread hatred and lies? I see many many many
I see the Master of Ceremony reaching for more mics
To free 'em from the grips of lies and hype
And again speak forth the light

Funky type poet that get loose like aerobics
You know I be slamming suckers.  When I’m
Not on the mic, I’m making more moves than a dance instructor

Nowadays, I come with more styles than fashion designers

So watch how I hit ‘em
In ‘95 and beyond, Lord Finesse is true and living

With a newspaper under his head and hair
I think
He would be down for me to tell him that he'd been waiting 'round here for all of his life
And
It took time for the soul to come

And when you sleep there
It won't get wet when you wake up

And so you dry in the sunlight
You sit there and you prepare to make a move
And so you go through each and every can
Lookin' inside tryin' to see somethin' that you didn't
See last night, wantin' to get somethin' to eat
And you go down the street
You see some friends of yours and then they all speak

But you can't 'cause you just got put out on your own

little john,house land*,1985,"Solo Dolo Part II Lyrics[Intro: Kid Cudi]
I don't need, I don't need nobody

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Please shut the front door and walk right in
In the land of the man who rock it hard for them
Super Solo Dolo attack, run and tell that
If you'd like to know, yes, I am on acid
Who could it be? K-I-D
Searching all day in the streets for DMT
Don't sip it, though - it couldn't answer
Drip, trip all day - bumpin' MGMT, homie
Watch on who you hate on, fam, without the facts
Sad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat
To me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that
You never seen a nigga like me?
I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth
'Cause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about
But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill
But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip
Hoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'
I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber-jabber
Mmm, you almost got me, but sucker, I'm not a sucker
Better get on back
You pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack
And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts
The world know what it be: Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo, C.U.D., repeat it
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches, and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I really want it, need it
Break bread or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out ""Little Johnny is dead!"" (Oh, you dead, nigga)
You wish me well, I wish you Hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
If my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell it to meet me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass-whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn't
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches, and dirty drums

Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille

Add another crew to your favo-ritos
Yes we knows our shit is flavor
In battle, I rip it, and it gets hectic after
I flipped the script like a dyslexic actor
You're no factor
I got the type of skills that make you wanna quit
I might be ill and my mic instills that old beyonder shit
I palm this shit, what's seen next is keen text
Be-ing ex-pelled from my diaphragm
I'm flyer, damn, would you grok it, can't you receive it
I bust like cleavage, rock shit, then I leave it
In shambles, 'cause I can like Campbell's
A sample of Tajai, is much more than ample
[Verse 2: A-Plus]
Yo, who the hell are you? You're not me
I got me and three brothers that are cocky
To rock the masses, whippin niggas asses
At last it's, appropriate to show that I can blast kids
I'm quick to stick a dick in skin
I'm figuring I hinder men, so let's sin, and watch this nigga win
I'm making corpses, of course I score kids
I'm morbid, 'cause it makes me think of more shit to kick
Leave me alone, back the hell up Hobbes
I never thought my son would ever try to beat up pops
I got a leather strap, for the fella that
Wanna tell the mack lies, I send em back with black eyes

I ain't trippin, what I'm flipping's on the contrary
To your weakness, retreat if you wanna restrain
From being beat, I freak lifting syllables
So kill the bullcrap, I'm arousing, dousing, drowning
When my sound swings, I found things
To bequeath, you're beneath, you need relief, to be brief
I crushed ya, flushed ya, from the cypher
'Cause I sliced your life to pieces
In ruins, I screw in, skills like drills
So who and, what army can harm me?
Kill the noise, my boys never lack poise
But you wack toys get played as I slay
[Verse 4: Opio]
My shit drives you crazy flip it backwards and it plays the
Satanic messages, I guess it is my nature
To break your mental barriers to take your body over
Drove ya, off a cliff, I got the gift to shapeshift
I encourage say nigga suicidal
The shit I write'll, make you clutch a bible
I got the Cali type styles, I wipe smiles
And smirks off of jerks 'cause that weak shit don't never work
Niggas is whack as fuck your over
Get your life together, find some direction cluck nigga
I got the titanium steel verse, slicin' through
With some shit that you'll never ever do

Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Point didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the store
Caught a player slipping
But now I lay it to the floor just like carpet
'Cause I got the heat in my baby momma name now
Never bragging just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad, I learned my lesson
Never talk to strangers in the trap and answer questions
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons 'cause we don't sell dope
That you distribute
We don't contribute to your clandestine activity
My soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate—liars and thieves; they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they coil

We won't be able to ride out till two thousand four
But not for long 'cause we got a better sack to serve
Tryna take you other people 'fore your rims at the curb
'Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go 'head, go 'head

How does it feel when you've got no food?
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
How does it feel when you've got no food?
So I left my gate an' went out for a walk
How does it feel when you've got no food?
As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I heard them say
How does it feel when you've got no food?

[Chorus]
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side (I say)
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side
It are go bun, give me di music, make mi jump an' prance
It are go dun, give mi di music, make mi rockin' at di dance
Jah know! *Scatting*

[Verse 2]
So I stopped to find out what was going on
How does it feel when you've got no food?
'Cause the spirit of Jah, you know he leads you on
How does it feel when you've got no food?
There was a ring of dreads an' a session was there in swing
How does it feel when you've got no food?
You could feel the chill as I seen an' heard them say
How does it feel when you've got no food?
[Chorus]
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side (I say)
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side
It are go bun, give me di music, make mi jump an' prance
It are go dun, give mi di music, make mi rockin' at di dance
Jah know!

[Bridge 1]
Now mi say listen to di drum, an' mi say listen to di bass
Give mi little music, make mi wind up mi waist
Mi say, listen to di drum, an' mi say listen to di bass
Give mi little music, make mi wind up mi waist (I say)

[Chorus]
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side (I say)
Pass di Dutchie 'pon di left hand side

m?tley cr?e,fight for your rights,1985,"Food, Clothes & Shelter Pt. 2 Lyrics(stic.man)
Yeah ... for all my peoples that's hungry

(Chorus)
A nigga need food
You got to have food for ya health, and clothes
Gear to keep esteem for yaself, son, shelter
A place to lay for rest when ya stressed over life
Cause it's trife and ain't no god gon help ya

(stic.man)
I feel the winter heart creepin
Vicious as the wind, which is life, when it's deep without a meanin
A trife scene it screams, niggas fiendin
The pipe dream and some be seemin like the only way to keep
Breathin in the slums -- but nothing comes
And keeping funds is like dreamin
My situation no solution, even the young become demons
Where I'm from shit is unyielding
Something like three-hundred million gun wielding black rats trapped in one building
With low ceilings, and no feelings
Cutthroat villains, dope dealings, and glossy eyed pavilions
Sunken faces, and powder traces
My people slave for the basics
The powerless devoured in the matrix
Of politics, pimps and glass pipes
From gun blast and flickin off blunt ash, the cash heist
The fast life where the have-nots rule
Stick and grab plots, toting tools, victim last by some jewels
Round the world, we stay stuck in capsules, shackled
And crackas got homes like castles
I figure the only way this nigga got to go is wild
Plottin licks for liberation, stockin cap style
(Chorus x2)
(M-1)
I was born in the storm hearin gun clap from thunder
See my childhood peers, catchin years in the numbers
I wake up from hunger, try to lift the stress that I'm under
How I made it this far makes me wonder
You in a fight for your life, for basic human rights
Can't afford the boomin prices, it's economic crisis
Life is a sacrifice, I'm down to my last bag of rice
They forcin us to live like laboratory mice
Like fuckin laboratory mice that's right
You wear the camaflouge, but do you choose to live the soldiers life
I told u before this is a war not a play fight
Taught to be a slave from the womb to the gravesite
Some of us even share the views of the canaanites
Tryna be white, but they gon lose in this game of life
So dead that! I tie my dread back and scheme
Put a star on my Red, Black and Green

(Chorus x2)

(Bridge)
What do power mean
Our team seem to think it means sour cream
Cause our dreams got us fiendin for the power, son
And Huey P. said political power come from the barrel of the gun
What do power mean, I believe in thieving
And smoking weed, everything happens for a reason
I hope my seed grow up and get even, it's open season

But she pour that Rosé in the glass and start toasting
Toasting to her past, she be toasting to her health
But the saddest part about it she be toasting with herself
And she passive, that emotional baggage she can’t just throw away
So she carry-on, that pain she tries to hide like a stowaway

snow,ease up,1993,"Ease Up LyricsHere's a real sad song
A song that must be sung
Think about the days when we were young
When we were kids girl all you wanted to do was play
But that was then and look at how you're living today
It's making me sad and almost brings me tears
But you may just open your eyes when the smoke clears
Girl what happened to the smile that used to clean
Once upon a time in your life you used to dream
At the top of the swim team but now you're drownin'
How quick your change was the most astounding
What you're gonna do is you against the world
You started off being such a sweet girl
Times go by, and years they start to drift
Now you're staring down a deep cliff
You can pour but don't overflow the cup
Girl you better
[Hook]
Ease up
So down
Girl you better change your life around (ease up)
So down (ease up)
So down
Girl you better change your life around (ease up)

No longer kids now we're considered as teens
Now we start learning what the letters in life mean
You had a good home living the good life - who knows
You might have made somebody a good wife
How is it wrong when things which are so fun
Now you walk around with a body with no mind
You entered the gateway to all life choices
Your brain was kinda hollow so you followed the voices
And you let it mislead ya
It took your body and soul and it said that it freed ya
Each and every girl like you is a sad case
You always have a beautiful look on a sad face
It could never be the way that it was
But if you're on the dope then that's what the dope does
If you pour don't overflow the cup

And now it comes to the final solution
Robbing and stealing and prostitution
Can't you see that your world is a shamble?
Life is a big game with plenty of gambles
So much time many things that are undone
No longer you cause there's you and a young son
You got one there are girls with two or three
Can't get a fix on 'em it's driving 'em up a tree
Just stop and think of your young child
Before he winds up as a name in a closed file
As I reminisce and take a look back
I wish I knew what to do to put you on the right track
But yet the train that left the station
And your money's on a permanent vacation
The more you pour you overflow the cup

lighter shade of brown,hip hop locos,1992,"Hip Hop Locos LyricsYou might ask is why we call ourselves the hip hop locos
Baking like Boston beans fartin out our vocals
No laxative for the shit that we get
So pass it on to Mike you Mikey he likes it
Others disapprove of the move that we swing
Not a brown underground thing not a pop thing
Yo you gotta come hard hey yo we in their face
I switch pop to hip hop to pop both ways
Versatile some should learn the definition
If money is the key then sucka why you dissin
The rap scene is hectic when it ends from when it starts
But most rap groups today are found on the pop charts
Don't get us wrong we prefer the funk better
But a job is a job for the real go getter
Standing in the spotlight here come the bros
Throwing down with the brown on the hip hop locos
Chorus 2x
Hippity hop what?
The hippity hop locos
Hippity hop what?
The hippity hop locos

Once again its on never the same old song
Cause me and my boy you know that we got it going on
Listen to while I flow
Got the skills to let em know
So let me be the one that was the one
Who told you so check it
Most didn't think we could flow rhymes
Excite write produce the whole 9
I don't want to respect cause I get mine
You got static raise up cause its fight time
I'm the beginning to end you gets no win
I put my fist to your chin you working
Pound for pound I hold my own when I come around
So ain't nothin but a come up when I'm throwin down
Like this like that spit game when I rap
Got back to bum rush and filled your cap
So everybody gather round and peep the vocal
Its the D also known as the hip hop locos

Chorus 3.5X
Versatile some should learn the definition 3x
I switch pop to hip hop to pop both ways
Versatile some should learn the definition 3x
I switch pop to hip hop to pop both ways

Now the brothers help me out on the side with my rap skills
Did what I had to do now its time to show you the deal
Never rap on the mic intoxicated
I might of hit the drink but the crew you know I can't fade it
19 years old and I never in the twelfth
For me being a loco I had to go myself
]From Santa Ana the city that gave me my pride
I kicked it and I chilled with the homies on the Westside
Born and raised a baby Latin with my little Latin friends
Thinking of ways so that we could make ends
Always stuck to hip hop cause hip hop won't flop
So let us swing our thing and let it rain like a rain drop
Snap back go pop cause the shop has been rocked
With a style that they call a hipper shade of hip hop
Goes out to those both friends and foes
As we close
Ugh..The hip hop locos

Song: Hole in the Bucket

(Money Money Money Money Nothin But Money)

I work 9 to 5 but it starts in the PM
And I love the sunrise so I step out in the AM
The street is black and shiny from the nightly rainin'
The glory of the light it brings evaporation
Morning's fresh oxygen cleanest
I take a deep hit help my mind stay the greenest
I'm already wake so I'm not drinkin' coffee
Don't wanna cigarette, cause it's a form of slavery
Walk into the store cause I need a few items
The sun heats my blood like a hit of vitamins
Need to buy some food and some 'poo for my dreads
I can't remember why but I need a spool of thread
Man with dirty dreads, he steps around the corner
He asks me for a dime, a nickel or a quarter
I don't have any change so I'm steppin' along
And as I'm walkin' past he sings to me a song...
(chorus)
There's a hole in the bucket
Dear Liza, dear Liza
There's a hole in the bucket
Dear Liza, dear Liza

The day is pickin' up cause I'm hummin' his song
The buses and the people all keep movin' along
To the shopkeeper I say ""was'sup?""
And I'm thinkin' about the man who's holdin' up the cup
I pay for all the stuff and get a pocketful of change
Should I give it to the man's the question in my brain
What's gonna happen if I give the man a dime?
I don't wanna pay for anotha brotha's wine
What's gonna happen if I give the man a quarter?
Will he find a dealer and try to place an order?
What's gonna happen if I give the man a nickel
Will he buy some food or some pork that's been pickled?
I'm not responsible for the man's depression
How can I find compassion in the midst of recession?
How come all these questions keep fuckin' with my head
And I still can't rememba why I need a spool of thread

(chorus)

He's starin' in my eyes just as I'm walkin' past
I'm tryin to avoid him cause I know he's gonna ask
Me about the coinage that is in my pocket
But I don't know if I should put it in his bucket
Walk right past him to think about it more
Back at the crib I'm openin' up the door
A pocketful of change it don't mean a lot to me
My cup is half full but his is empty
I put back on my cap and I start headin' back
I reach into my pocket and I have a heart attack
Well as I'm diggin' deep I scream ""oh no!""
There's nothin' in the pocket but a great big hole
While I was busy thinkin' if he would buy smack
The jingle in my pocket it slipped through the cracks
No one has the change and it's fuckin' up my head
But now I know the reason why I had to buy the thread!

dc talk,what if i stumble?,1995,"What If I Stumble? Lyrics[Intro: Brennan Manning]
The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today
Is Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips
Then walk out the door and deny him by their lifestyle
That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable

What if I stumble?
What if I fall?

[Verse 1]
Is this one for the people?
Is this one for the Lord?
Or do I simply serenade
For things I must afford?
You can jumble them together
My conflict still remains
Holiness is calling
In the midst of courting fame
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause I see the trust in their eyes
Though the sky is falling
They need Your love in their lives
Compromise is calling

What if I fall?
What if I lose my step
And I make fools of us all?
Will the love continue
When my walk becomes a crawl?
What if I stumble
And what if I fall?

For I cannot compose
The fear that lives within me
Or the rate at which it grows
If struggle has a purpose
On the narrow road you've carved
Why do I dread my trespasses
Will leave a deadly scar

Do they see the fear in my eyes?
Are they so revealing?
This time I cannot disguise
All the doubt I'm feeling

What if I lose my step
And I make fools of us all?
Will the love continue
When my walk becomes a crawl?

And what if I fall?

And you know that
You're up against a wall
It's about to fall

And you know that
You're up against a wall
It's about to fall
Everyone's got to crawl

To bridge gaps in generations for future plantations

Of one breed, one seed, to good goals we proceed
Nowadays I strive to be a very good influence
Even though not too long ago I was a truant
Now I'm droppin' it on this and many broad topics
From man's obsession with money to holy prophets
Like Mohammed, yo, you know the scene is so freaky
Enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me
Now I got hip-hop acts posin' like fat cats
Lex and a Rolex, Moet and a top hat
But what about your contract, slick? Is you proper?

And a half million pounds. That's more money than most people
Can dream of. But then
Some people have big dreams

What if we get caught? - 'Course we won't! - But say we do? -
Don't worry
Just think about the money

Others hang around you when there's lots of it around
But worst of all are people who really have no need

They do it for these reasons
In spite and out of greed

Just for money

Valentine's Day - red roses -
It's said that some have died for love
In North Clark Street
Chicago

They died for money - died for money

Cops always line you up with your nose in the bricks

They'll expect that
Once their backs are turned
We'll just pepper the wall with them. -

I've used 'em before

c?line dion,the colour of my love,1993,"The Trip LyricsWhistles blowing, people get on trains
Without knowing where they're going
Someone's daughter, someone's sister
Someone's teacher going down the road

With a body, a handkerchief
And a hatchet from an unspeakable crime
But there's no one waiting for them
There's no judgement down the line

Banjos ring and chickens squall
And little babies crow
The winter leaves, and the spring unwinds
And summer comes again, you know
Pink is the color of my true love's dress
And black is the color of her heart
But I could never leave old Virginie
And so it never parts

Ebony face, ebony nails
Ebony coffin on the rails
Moving south, C-O-D
Going home to mother

Some said for valor, for glory, for treasure, for pride
Sometimes brother hates brother

[Chorus]
So take a trip wherever your conscience has to roam
It's much too hard to try to live a lie at home

My boots are cracked with road dirt and asphalt
Spit and broken dreams
Chewing gum and safety pins
All would hold me in at the seams

My pegs are loose, my screws too tightly wound to get in tune
But I still try sometimes on those golden summer afternoons

[Chorus]
So take a trip wherever your conscience has to roam
It's much too hard to try to live a lie at home
[Instrumental solo]

There's a picture of an old black man in a beaver hat
He wears a hidden smile and a pair of white spats
Don't pretend you didn't notice his stare
You're edgy and sweating and loaded for bear

The Skeleton's Dance tonight
Bring your bottle and your boots
And your mandolin that Bianca Alatorre
Tried to shoot

Ah but what's a bullet hole or two between friends?
And who can say when the well goes dry
Or where the story ends?

[Chorus]
So take a trip wherever your conscience has to roam
It's much too hard to try to live a lie at home

[Instrumental solo]

Hotel lives and hotel wives
That come and go with the sheets
But what's a marriage
If it can't be held up to kitchen heat?
Once I knew each valley and that beautiful shore
But I don't go to the summer fair much anymore

[Chorus]
So take a trip wherever your conscience says to roam
It's much too much to try and live a lie at home

Your harmonica is blown, baby
Throw it away
Your denim shirt is ragged
And your dirty collar is frayed

I tried to play my horn for you
But I couldn't seem to find a note
So I picked up pen and paper
And this is what I wrote

[Chorus]
Go take a trip wherever your conscience has to roam
It's much too hard to try to live a lie at home

I need the badass on this one
But like a good actor im a improvise
Everybody to criticize my talent
Which we all know is hash tag estalgic
I got punch lines that a knock you out
Hook that a leave you shook
Better duck and cover
Who really raising us
Rap moguls or our mothers
Don't lose your morals
Word from the wise man on his grind trying to get a deal
Just keep it real
Hold on to your psyche
Ask yourself, could you really give up the nike
And other clothes with a logo
(no bro cause that's what gets me the hoes, yo)
So shallow
But this is deeper then that
I'm trying to tap into my chi
Grab a hold of my spirit
Bring it out the dark
Take the shackles off of it and it let roar
[Hook]

This is so swank, not trill
Its the beast coast you know the deal
We just too real

[Verse 2: Mack Montana]

A pair of raybans hide the pride inside my eyes
A group of black kids keep it swank till we demise
Never spit no bloods or crips
Seen a nigga get his melon split for fish and chips, ain't that a bitch?
Im just living until the day it comes
Cypher with my bros spitting rhymes in the a.m
Cooler than a fan, Dapper Dan
Fresh then than the ones you came with
Kicking rhymes for the ages
Hidden colors helped the lost kid find his prime
Most of my kind got the criminal mind
We'll never get a second chance to pave this road
Even though we was the first ones to pave this road
Nothing personal against you
I'm just saying if something happened and you vanished then I probably wouldn't miss you
Kill them softly with this kitchen utensil
Too much pride never dies cause its stuck in my mental
[Hook]

[Verse 3: JoJo]

Heres that young man again with the mind sharper then a splinter
From the streets wheres its colder than the winter
So the gangsters and the thugs lurking always carry heat
They be hugging the block
Pitching the yolo dipping dodging them cops
Trying to make another pay to add up with the money coming in first of the month from the government
They just trying to eat
A smalll difference between me and them is that im tryng to have feast
My knowledge one day could help me get up out these streets
The powers in the heart
The strength is in the mind
Its grinder
Hold up, ain't no other option
Started from the bottom we can finish at the opposite
It ain't no stopping us from the bottom to the top, we rise
We grind to shine
Head up to the sky
If you ain't living it up then you ain't alive
Punch lines box you up like rocky in the ring

wu-tang clan,shame on a nigga,1993,"Shame on a Nigga Lyrics[Intro: Sample, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, and Raekwon]

[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck—I'll fuck your ass up!

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard & Raekwon]
Yo, hut one, hut two, hut three—hut!
Ol' Dirty Bastard, live and uncut
Styles unbreakable, shatterproof
To the young youth, you wanna get gun? Shoot!
Blaow! How you like me now? Don't fuck the style
Ruthless, wild—do you wanna
Get your teeth knocked the fuck out?
Wanna get on it like that? Well, then, shout!
[Verse 2: Method Man]
Yo, RZA, yo, razor—hit me with the major
The damage, my clan understand it, be flavor
Gunnin', hummin', comin' at ya
First I'm gonna get ya, once I got ya, I gat ya
You could never capture the Method Man's stature
For rhyme and for rapture, got niggas resignin', now master
My style? Never!
I put the fuckin' buck in the wild, kid, I'm terror, razor-sharp
I sever, the head from the shoulders, I'm better than my compet'ta
You mean competitor, whatever, let's get together

[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the tri—blaow!

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
I react so thick, I'm phat, and yo
Rae came blowin' and blew off your headphones, black
Rap from, yo, Cali to Texas
Smoother than a Lexus, now's my turn to wreck this
Brothers approach and half step
But ain't heard half of it yet and I bet you're not a fuckin' vet
So, when you see me on the real
Formin' like Voltron, remember I got deep like a Navy Seal
[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
I'll fuck your ass up!

[Verse 4: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo!
I come with that ol' loco style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bifocals
I'm no joker, play me as a joker
Be on you like a house on fire—smoke ya
Crews be actin' like they gangs, anyway
Be like, ""Warriors, come out and play!""
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once—but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit stains in my drawers
So I can get fizzy-funky for ya
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang
Rah! Here comes the Tiger vs. Crane
I'll be like wild with my style
Punk—you play me, chump, you get jumped
Wu! is comin' through at a theater near you
And get funk like a shoe
What?

diamond & the psychotic neurotics,i went for mine,1992,"I Went For Mine Lyrics[ VERSE 1 ]
My name is Diamond, yup, you've guessed it
Ran a thousand schemes, and I've never been arrested
I guess I'm lucky, cause I'm young and I'm a black man
And intelligent, so everything is relevant
Vision is clear, don't have to wear contacts
Got a good lawyer, no shorts in my contract
Beats are selected with the highest scrutiny
I play Mr. Christian and just take mutiny
Cause this is my destiny, a lotta brothers keep testin me
But you haven't heard the best from me
So remember one thing
Aiyo, it ain't no thing but a chicken wing
Yeah, so sit back, and listen to the chit-chat
Sweet as a kit-kat (Diamond, where'd you get that
Beat from?) Yo, Jazzy dug in the crate
Needs another loop, so we added a flute
Then it came together, and I grabbed a pen
Then I double-checked it (for what?) loose ends
The object of a song is to keep your head movin
Hope you find a good A&R man... (haa)
A lot of acts get signed
And when the album comes out everyone says
""Aw manm, take that record off, don't waste my time""
Due to that fact, I went for mine
I went for mine
Aiyo, I went for mine
I went for mine
So go for yours
[ VERSE 2 ]
I overcome hurdles like Edwin Moses
Everything is planned, but no one knows this
I never go broke, since I don't sweat that
I make moves like a man on X-Lax
D-i to the a-m to the o-n-d
Aiyo, you got no wins, gee
So back up and take a breather, cause either
You must be on acid or from Lake Placid
I hop to it like a kangaroo
I got jumped by a gang of two
But I showed them a thang or two
Cause I'm not no chump
Now I clock notes cause I make you move your rump
Nothing's for granted, grew up in the projects
Used to wear Taylors and chinese mock necks
Came a long way from back in the days
When Show went to Smith, and I went to Hayes
That was the past, and the future will be better
Pass the Moët and keep the Cream Armaretto
Peace to Greg Nice and my man Fat Joe
My man O.G. and the rest of the homies
The Zulu Nation for the foundation
>From when I was a kid watchin _Lost In Space_, and
I never forget, cause I'm totally committed
To make slammin joints, just to prove my point
In '92 you can't waste no time
(Word) go for yours, cause I went for mine
And you know that
And you don't stop
And you know that
Cause I won't drop
I went for mine
Aiyo, I went for mine
And to my sister Eugenia
You're in the house
I went for mine
So go for yours, kid
And to my man Showbiz and all that

the grace thrillers,tell me the story,1995,"Madagascar Lyrics[Verse 1]
This is the story
The epitome of a lands grace
Framed like a picture case
The eyes are focused
Awakened by revelations
Flustered by tribulations
Slaughter on the cheeks
Cutting history
Slicing land
Edward scissor hands
Who's the orphan
A body with rivers for tears
That chase
The contours
Of a silhouette face
Unify to dominate
Put the opposition on a plate
Running base
Feed your face
Knowledge and the skill
To live and get those bills paid
Give out meals
To the haters
Because your'e real
Soul food
Want to cage us like animals
And sell kills for thrills
They need to chill
The globe is warming
But they will still
Be cold and they know

[Hook}
Madagascar sketched in my metaphorical pen
Hiii power made a gas car for them
Gased up with celestially essence
On a trip for evading crypts on a whim
To a spirit rocket ship for the kin
To escape the box of a map
Where the sun where the people are at
Sweet nothings and reflections tell me  something
[Verse 2]
My nose is pierced
Because the landscape on
My face needed a sun
Fierce
To shine light on the dark side
Of its mountains
A feather behind my ear tatted
Am I a pain addict
Voice of the omnipotent
No static
Nothing can hurt you here
Here is where you surface your tears
You cup runneth over where
From your eyes
You will find abundance in disguise

My Ears are pierced
To flute everything I hear
Of the beat of one
Through
To the center drum
Wholes configured
To the alignments
Feel free to fill in
The blanks application
[Verse 3]
Wholes in the loops
For the belt of Orion
What's the stitch
In the cloak
Of the almighty one
Zeal
Horned to sound
One March pon the ground
The triumph
Many names meaning Zion
Zion
Zion
Lineage of the lion
And that roar goes bang
Like Khalifa we bring the gang
Ring ring intellectuals
Smashing phonies like vegetables
The hating is detestable
In the jungle of politic backlash
Don't get in the way of the flow cash
The people are hungry
Dundee
Crocodile appetites, insight
Like the rain
You can't stop
The light

You can't stop The light
You can't stop The lig-ht

Holy mackerel!

Alright now
Yo, check it:

[Verse 1]
I grab the mic and commence to rip shit
Papes in the pocks 'cause I make a dipshit
Flip the script just like Marlon Brando
Run more game than that park in Orlando
Florida, or the other in Cali
And if I go broke I'll just pimp Sally
Pushin' the bush but I don't mean George
Fake the funk and end up in a morgue
But no, not me—no way, home slice
And when I play cee-lo I use my own dice
On the down low but I don't wear a hoodie
Run to the store 'cause Diamond got the goodies
And the treats and the beats for the Jeep
That were made by me and the man with Nikes on his feet
So everybody gather, I'm paid like Dan Rather
You want to flip shit? It strictly don't matter
'Cause you can't do me nothing, no sense in bluffing
I'll cook that ass like Stove Top Stuffing
Stay on your ball while I steal the show
Yeah, and act like you know
[Hook: Sampled]
This is the fly shit that you seek
Really now brotha

[Verse 2]
Yo, you know you can't front: Diamond D got the flow
But some didn't know 'cause I play down low
I got more tricks than a Hunts Point ho
Search for beats with my man called Show
Then I shoot the gift with my man Fat Joe
I put hits together just like an old pro
And you gotta add me, 'cause like a fly I'm on some other shit
I elevate like an escalator
So hold your head and I'll test you later
So come along with the man:
I'm shuttin' shit down just like the Son of Sam
But my name ain't David (hell no!)
And for the bullshit you can save it
Yo, if I decide to pursue a career in hip-hop what should I do?
What would you do if it happened to you?
Out with the old and in with the new
People sit back and then they assume
But I recline and just hit the boom

[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I like to gamble but I don't play the horses
It's '92 and you know who the boss is:
Diamond—yeah, you know the chubby kid
Envious friends say ""I wonder what the hell he did
To blow up so fast,"" and they move slow as
A turtle, or a fat chick in a girdle
Sittin' around eatin' bogeys
Pop the video and start sweatin' to the oldies
Get a life, no need to live trife
I'm smooth as butter, like my man called Phife
Calm, collected, cool, respected
When things get hectic, the only antiseptic
Is real hip-hop so I head to the lab
Fry an MC like the bacon on a slab
Or the chicken from Kentucky, brothers say I'm lucky
Keep a jimmy in my pocket 'cause the stunts wanna...

Wrapped in strands of fist and bone

You can look outside your window
He doesn't have to know
We can talk a while, baby
We can take it nice and slow

All your life is such a shame, shame, shame
All your love is just a dream, dream, dream
Well, are you happy where you're sleeping?
Does he keep you safe and warm?
Does he tell you when you're sorry?
Does he tell you when you're wrong?

Well, I've been watching you for hours
It's been years since we were born
We were perfect when we started
I've been wondering where we've gone

All your life is such a shame, shame, shame
All your love is just a dream, dream, dream

Well, I dreamt I saw you walking
Up a hillside in the snow
Casting shadows on the winter sky
As you stood there counting crows
One for sorrow, two for joy
Three for girls, and four for boys
Five for silver, six for gold
Seven for a secret never to be told

But there's a bird that nests inside you
Sleeping underneath your skin
Yeah, when you open up your wings to speak
I wish you'd let me in
All your life is such a shame, shame, shame
All your love is just a dream, dream, dream
Open up your eyes, you can see the flames, flames, flames
Of your wasted life, you should be ashamed

m?tley cr?e,smoke the sky,1994,"Hell’s Forecast (Mike E. Clark Remix) LyricsI never seen so many
Horrified looks on people's faces

Something had woke me a thump on my roof
It was followed by crashing more thumping ensued
I jumped out of my bed thinking I've been invaded
Heard smashing more pounding, the sound escalated
Looked out of my window blood dripped down the glass
I see bodies lay twisted and mangled on grass
I ran into the main room and Shaggy was dead
So was Nate the Mac, Jumpsteady, and ABK
Bolted out of the house to see if it's a joke
I heard hundreds of car alarms saw flames and smoke
And the sky above red I see dead bodies fallin'
It's raining with corpses the blood is appalling
Mama told me when it rains IT POURS
But never mentioned dead bodies DEAD BODIES
Mama told me when it rains IT POURS
La de da da de la da de DEAD BODIES

I never seen so many
Horrified looks on people's faces

Some hang off fences, phone wires, and trees
Some hang dead from the light post high up off the street
They create giant shadows of dead bodies hangin'
Yet more keep on fallin', you hear hundreds bangin'
Dead bodies lay randomly some stack in piles
On all of there faces pure horror no smiles
I see children and elders and ninjas my age
All lay naked and mangled most withered for days
I found safety a shelter I'm under a tree
Only fingers and organs come falling on me
I lay sleepless for days as the raining continued
The heat of the sun baking corpses like food
Then it finally stopped I walk knee deep in blood
Over piles of bodies threw what was my hood
It was right at that moment the Wraith had appeared
And the message it left me might sound kind of weird
But take all that I'm seeing and opposite that
Truth is I'm the one dead and this is my tiP s'lleH
My Hell's Pit
Si-si siht dna daed eno eht m'I

scarface,no tears,1994,"No Tears Lyrics[Verse]
Now the funeral is over, and all the tears are dried up
Niggas hanging tape on the cut getting fired up
Looking for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie
An eye for an eye, so now your life is what you owe me
Look deep into the eyes of your motherfucking killer
I want you to witness your motherfucking murder, nigga
And since you wants to kill then your ass has gots to fry
But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slipped I guess you sleep
You sho' nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
Cause where I come from yo, everybody's got a gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end
I'm rolling through your hood and now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house now your sister's life's in danger (by a total stranger)
With a gang of, niggas wanting to bang you
And hang you, stain you, with one up in the chamber
Let's take a trip up Holaway
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
We standing up for our own shit
And if you outside the clique then you die, bitch
It ain't no love in this motherfucker
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother, uh
Because we real with this shit so we stay true
And since we bang then we do what O.G. say do
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror so I'm looking at me vaguely
But I can't seem to fade me
I've got my pistol pawn cocked
Ready to lick shots nonstop until I see your monkey-ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit you motherfuckers know who run it
So when you put this motherfucker to the test
You gotta realize something nigga
You fucking with the very best
I got this killa up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother so I talk to my diary
I'm going off on the deep end
I found myself face-to-face with myself while I'm sleeping
I see your picture in my head and my hands shake
You can run, you can hide but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this mutherfucker fore he gets to me
So in your own blood, you'll bathe
And I won't stop until I put this motherfucker in his fucking grave
And I can say this once again
You can cry but you'll still die
They'll be no tears in the end

I decided we should be friends, hey
But now we're going 'round in circles

Head Over Heels

[Verse 1: Roland Orzabal]
I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration - could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
You're just, just, just wasting time

[Chorus: Roland Orzabal]
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't throw it away

[Post-Chorus: Roland Orzabal]
Throw it away
Throw it away
[Verse 2: Roland Orzabal, Curt Smith]
I made a fire, I’m watching it burn
I thought of your future
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last?
No, no, no, have you no ambition?
My mother and my brother’s used to breathing clean air
Nothing ever changes when you’re acting your age
And dreaming I’m a doctor
Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby
It’s hard to be a man when there’s a gun in your hand
Nothing ever changes when you’re acting your age
Oh, I feel so

[Chorus: Roland Orzabal]
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart

Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck

[Verse 1]
I need a ruffneck
I need a dude with a attitude
Only needs his fingers with his food
Karl Kani saggin', timbos draggin'
Frontin' in his ride with his home boys braggin'
Lying 'bout the Lyte how he knocked boots last night
But he's a ruffneck, so that's alright
Triple o baldie under the hood
Makin' noise with the boys, up to no good
C-low on the down low
Cops come around so ruffneck front like he gotta go
Evil grin with a mouth full of gold teeth
Startin' beef is how he spells relief
Actin' like he don't care
But all I gotta do is beep him 911 and he'll be there
Right by my side with his ruffneck tactics
Ruffneck attitude, the ruffneck bastard

Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck
I need it and I want it so I gotta get a ruffneck!

[Verse 2]
I need a ruffneck
I need a man that's quick and swift
To put out the spliff and get stiff
Boxer shorts, everything is fitting large
But he don’t gotta be large to be in charge
Pumpin' in and out and out and in and here we go
He knows exactly how I want my flow and that's slow
Never questioning can he get buck wild
He's gotta smack it, lick it, swallow it up style
Drink a beer, sittin' his chair
Hands in his pants, fiddlin' with his dick hairs
He's a rudeboy, a raggamuf'
Ready to bag another brother that he ranks not ruff enough
Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't right
And if he ain't ruff, well then he's all wrong for the Lyte
I love my ruffneck and ain't nothing going down
Or going up if my ruffneck ain't in town

[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I need a ruffneck
I need a man that don't snitch like a bitch
Shed tears or switch
Doin' whatever it takes to make ends meet
But never meetin' the end cause he knows the street
He eat, sleep, shit, fuck, eat, sleep, shit
Then it's back to the streets to make a buck quick
Quick to beg even though gimme gottem here
Hit'em wit a bit a skins then he's out of there
On the avenue girls are passin' thru
Too much of ruffneck so they ain't havin' you
Hard boppin' always grabbin' his jock and braggin' about his tec
Is the wannabe ruffneck
That's the kind you gotta watch out for
Just to get a rep he'll pull the plug on the tour
Pissin' in corners, doing 80 by funeral mourners
Showing little respect, now that's a ruffneck!

Slamming sucker fuckers like the wrestler Zeus
Crazier than 2Pac in the flick called Juice
Cock is longer than the hat worn by Dr. Seuss
Love a girl in Daisy Dukes like them kids called Duice
Gets paid to sex the hoochie like my main man Luke
Control the mic like Denzel on the girls
Wack MCs be on the nuts like Rocket J. Squirrel
The worst thing in the world is a sucker MC
Favorite rap group in the world is EPMD
Can't forget the De La, due to originality
And if I ever went solo my favorite MC would be me
Phife Dawg up in the house, I give a shout out to Snoopy
Peace to all the Questers, to hell with the groupies
Like um, Ralph Malph to Potsie, Brooklyn to Dodger
Laverne to Shirley, Rerun to Roger
Ren to the Stimpy, Laurel to Hardy
Q-Tip and Phife, they mash up the party
Kick the rhymes and more rhymes
Kick the beats and more beats

The women, the lingo, and all the other goods
Peace to the hoods, keep my shit on play
Please don't do the mute when you hear me on the juke
Brothers know the angle, it's the Star-Spangled black banner
Hook up the beats at the funk manor
If you want a roll, then the dough I be raking
The scope is on the world 'cause it's mine for the taking
You know I'm gonna do it
My shit is rock solid, but it flows like fluid
Chemists get confused of my ill composition
This is the third of the new Tribe addition
MCs be swinging, but a lot of them be missing
So shut your bloodclot and listen
'Cause I'm bringin you the ill rendition

The sisters are in so check the front line

Cast me into classes for electroshock
Straight incarcerated, the curriculum's a cell block
I'm swimming in half truths and it makes me wanna spit
Instructor come separate the healthy from the sick
Ya weigh me on a scale, smelling burnt skin
It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screaming from within
'Cause I'm cell locked in the doctrines of the right
Enslaved by dogma, talk about my birthrights
Yet at every turn I'm running into Hell's gates
So I grip the cannon like Fanon and pass the shells to my classmates
Aw, power to the people
'Cause the boss's right to live is mine to die
So I'm going out heavy sorta like Mount Tai
With the five centuries of penitentiary so let the guilty hang

Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggas
But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out, or even pull your fucking heater
To make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like King Shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I be saying Lakewood
You better be strapped cause them niggas over there just ain't good
Just being a hustler, serving the loyal customers
Rent was due on the first of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto', yo
But that's aight though, cause I be getting paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that dime

If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime
If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime

Time is slipping, slowly but surely
Niggas I used to hang with wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickel sacks crawl
To my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain
From being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous
I'm hanging with the P.A., nigga, ain't no changing us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fire shit, yo niggas gonna always toke
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fucked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up
I rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm slanging it from the South

Tried to ward off their attack
But our atom bombs were just no use

They were ugly, they were mean
Biggest heads I ever seen
They made everybody scream and shout
First they leveled Tokyo
Then New York was next to go

They wasted everybody on my block

And blow you up real good

And an evil lookin' grin
And they sure could use some manicures

They got eyes like some kinda bug

Luchified, cause many did and died
The mic wrecka, study Mecca, now building
Cause I love my shorties like Jesus loved children
Cause being smooth is the science I crafted
To a state, when they incarcerate me I wanna be free
And play some D on the high-scoring thrill from the Vernonville
Taking my yards with no bodyguards
My click's the first round draft pick for time in prison
So the only way to cover that is clean living

They went at Biggie and 2Pac in cars, that's why I'm my own chauffeur
You have to be better, I'm not getting down from the AMG
Let's say that my flow matured, and if you went ahead, I left you
Even the ones who don't speak Spanish are sending ""OMG""
All that is perfect is God's timing
I kept hustling and I didn't complain
Now I have the bedsheets Versace
Where I go they turn on the cameras
Lots say they were there since day one, but in reality, they weren't there at all
The incus are dressing like street guys, they think they know, they don't know anything
In this verse I was going to say my name, but you all know it already
[Chorus]
Look at me now, ayy; look at me know, haha
I just record the songs, they become hits by themselves
They want me to do bad, but this gets better, ayy
I was looking for quick money, excuse the wait
Look at me now, ayy; look at me know
I just record the songs, they become hits by themselves
They want me to do bad, but this gets better
I was looking for quick money, excuse the wait (Haha)

[Verse 2]
Forgive me if I got here late
I remember when I worked legally
The entry was slow, that's why the whole time my mind told me: ""Go deal""
Who you least suspect is a federal officer
If they stop me, I'm always going to accelerate
If she's hot, well bring her to see if it's true
And if her friend wants to come, she can also
They know that they have to talk about me, or if not they're not relevant
Right now I'm passing them on the side again, that's why you all are ahead
I never sold the stock, but I know all the thugs
Careful whenever you see me, the diamonds might leave you blind

[Chorus]
Look at me now, ayy; look at me know
I just record the songs, they become hits by themselves
They want me to do bad, but this gets better, ayy
I was looking for quick money, excuse the wait
Look at me now, ayy; look at me know

hank williams,i can't get you off of my mind,1985,"5000 Country Music Songs Lyrics[Verse 1]
I started writing country songs in 1962
Just a dream that I had on my mind
Now my girl and I got married in 1963
We tried so hard to keep our dreams alive

[Verse 2]
So I bought an old house-trailer out on the country side
You can't write country songs in town they say
(That's what they told me)
Well we packed up and moved out there and as the time went by
We found that we liked living free that way
[Verse 3]
Now I got me an old Cadillac just to have around
Cadillacs and country songs were meant to be
I heard that old Hank Williams, well he drove one just like mine
So I thought that something might rub off on me

[Chorus]
You can take what you want after I'm gone
It's only just a little place that we called home sweet home
It was one old house trailer, two rusty Cadillacs
And 5000 country music songs

[Verse 4]
Now I always sent my songs up to Nashville town
In case the boys couldn't use a guy like me
But the mailman brought 'em right back down and I think it made him sad
You're bound to get you one, just wait and see

[Verse 5]
Well I recall the year that Ray Price came through town
His tour bus parked about a mile from here
But I just sat there in the backseat of that old Coupe De Ville
Those shoes were just too big to fill that year

[Verse 6]
And a song on Bobby Bare would take you anywhere
If I'm still here it wasn't for lack of trying
My wife would tell me, ""Honey, now I'm feelin' somethin' there
Don't care if Bobby never reads a line""
[Chorus]
You can take what you want after I'm gone
It's only just a little place that we called home sweet home
It was one old house trailer, two rusty Cadillacs
And 5000 country music songs

[Bridge]
Then late one summer evening she called me to her side, saying
""Sing me something in your real old style
The one I like to hear Bobby Bare passed by
I'll just close my eyes and rest a while""

[Verse 7]
Now she liked that big old tree and the honeysuckle vine
A mockingbird that sang so tenderly
Well I just packed up all those song words and my old guitar
I locked 'em up and threw away the key

[Chorus]
So mister, take what you want after I'm gone
It's only just a little place that we called home sweet home
It was one old house trailer, two rusty Cadillacs

Yo, (Blaow) first of all, son, peep the arson
Many brothers I be sparkin' and bustin' mad light inside the dark
Call me dough snatcher, just the brother for the rapture
I hang glide, holdin' on strong, hard to capture
Extravagant, RZA bake the track and it's militant
Then I react like a convict and start killin' shit
It's manifested, the gods work like appliances
Dealin' in my cypher I revolve around sciences
The 9th chamber, leave you trapped inside my hallway
You try to flee but you got smoked up by the doorway (Blaow)
No question, I send your ass back right to the essence
Your whole frame is smothered in dirt, now how you restin'?
While I'll be trapped by sounds, locked behind loops
Throwin' niggas off airplanes 'cause cash rules (Cash rules)

Swallow this murder one verse like god degree
Then analyze my soundtrack for satisfaction
You adapt like a flashback, chain reaction

And built my dynasty without the Masonic hand gestures
Yeah, this is church right here
Young Black don’t give a fuck Amerikkka’s nightmare
Next level I’m a rebel with a cause
And you can say two words without no homo or a pause
Heard your bars and I’m somewhat appalled
So clapping at you got something to do with no applause
Memorize this slogan:
Whores, jaws and laws was made to be broken
Honestly what the fuck are y'all smoking?
Hip-Hop must be dead with the shit that y'all promoting
V-Nasty saying nigga ain’t the first for a rapper
But it’s ill how ignorance make her think that she Blacker
Coming out like race don’t matter
But it's White Girl Mob like the Ku Klux chapter

Whoever cosign her’s just a new age slave

Shit, I could fulfill your
Wish than dance on your grave like Thriller
So pick one finger the middle or the trigger

Born to be like soul mates

Now everyday I wake up I take out time
To give thanx that I'm still existing
Still insisting
That my people open up their eyes up
And wise up so we all can rise up
WAY ABOVE the rim of the muck
But we can't if we're stuck
In I don't give a fuck
And lost in a daze Lost in a maze
Trapped in amazement
And hard as cement is the head
And that why soon everything'll be dead
And red is the color of the blood that's spilling
And hella amounts is the totals of the killing
I'm tellin' ya is the sky is falling
But all you're worried about is sky balling
You're failing way outta control
And you ain't doing nothing but losing ya soul

I got no need for jewels cars and clothes
Need to slow my roll but can't grab control
It's unpredictable when we will go
I don't really know but it seems it's coming soon
The way that niggas actin we headed
For our doom but we assume that we immune
To death while niggas
Drippin sweat tryin to hold their breath
But aah! they slept while the time just crept
Now they tryin to awake but it ain't much left
Sometimes I think we blind either
No hope or faith my people can't wake up
We sleepin through the day
Think it's all great but to me it really ain't
When its time to face reality we turn to a drank
Or some dank then we can't think straight lets
Try to make a change for its gets too late cuz

Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town
Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down
Sleeping with an empty bottle, he's a sad and an empty hearted man
All he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can

[Chorus 1]
We always need to hear both sides of the story
Both sides of the story

[Verse 2]
A neighbourhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night
Young faces hide in the shadows, while they watch their mother and father fight
He says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says ""looks like it's just us from now on""
[Chorus 1]
All we always need to hear both sides of the story
We need to hear both sides of the story

And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
Until you hear both sides

[Verse 3]
Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the center of the storm
Neighbors once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn
They've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets
While small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat

[Chorus 1]
All we always need to hear both sides of the story

And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes

Until you see both sides

They were

[Verse 1]
Ah, he did what he had to do
He asked no questions
He had few conversations
The tar glistens in the noon heat
He tread across the grass, up onto, and down off of, the concrete abutments
Mirage on the highway
Ghosts in the tunnel
The dark cave
Out into the blinding light of day at breakneck speed
Every bolt rumbling
Glistening highway mirage groans
The slick surface
Careening into first the small mammal, and then screeching along the guard rail
Scraping paint and throwing sparks like sheets of pure terror for
400 yards over and over
With one final back and forth rocking motion coming to rest
Wait
The beautiful paint job hopelessly marred
Smoke and flames
[Verse 2]
Alright
So nice
He moved to the small creature
Screeching whistles of steam blowing off
On it's back, wheels spinning like a cinema classic
The door sags open and a man covered in blood drops the three feet or so to
The pavement
The car still rattling and shaking as if with a mind of it's own Unwilling to die
The man, forty-ish, also after a time, an agonizingly painful period of time
Is also unwilling to die

[Verse 3]
Suddenly all is quite quiet there in the sunlight on the highway
But what, what can I do?
I cannot move, everything is about broken
Blood everywhere, mixing with oil and gas
What's moving, must turn my head
Pain, white light, blinded
Some guy there kneeling in the blinded mirage of white light
All my strength to 'help'
Screaming now help me please
He tried to tamp out the bit of burning ember which had leapt from the wreck
Onto his grimy coat sleeve
Coughing blood
What's happen?
He's, he's inching towards truth
He strode of into the woods with the animal
It still lived
He didn't glance back at all
[Verse 4]
Still out ghosting the road
Death on the highway
Words crumble around me and fall with the weight of heaven
I cannot move
I'm beneath the great weight
I cannot see
My eyes are blinded
I am in the darkness
That's it

In despair I need it
In my mind I save it
In death I have it

The way that momma raised us was pure faith
So diablo wouldn't faze us or daze us
Or lay us down to sleep
Know the wolf from the sheep
Or the sheep who cried wolf
And threw the deadly hoof
While the wolf was asleep
I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too close
Sleep with my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin the game of life
The knife sits by throats of the young
And blows death straight through the lungs
As the mind gets washed by visions of sugar plums
But we shall overcome cause we ain't dumb
But we ain't smart, they got the girls by the hearts
And the niggas by the nuts
Ear, tongue and butts
Yeah, they're trying to fuck us up
But, shit, you know what's up
We gotta get with the movement
And move men soon
They consume every womb who bares
Beneath the stairs of their doom
Before they let a new soul bloom
Best believe they're gonna shove em in a tomb

Cause everytime I step to the microphone
I put my soul on 2 inch reels
That I don't even own

Early Saturday mornin I was cartoon gazin
Slowly broke into the kitchen
To fill a bowl with some Raisin Bran
As I ran up and down the TV stations
I witnessed Indian Joe
Getting tricked out of this nation
By a silly hillbilly
Who laughed as the shit happened
Everything's the same
The game continued into rappin
Deception is at an all-time high
You give a piece of your soul
To receive some crumbs from the pie
But you know I keep on rappin til the break of dawn
Even though it is my soul that I do not even own

Never do she once say, sir, where have you been?
No, she says, are you hungry?

Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way
You keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That'll really really hurt you one day

Here I am laying in the hospital
Bandaged from feet to head
Ya see I'm in the state of shock baby
Just that much from being dead

I didn't think she had the nerve, so here I am
I guess action speaks louder than words

[Refrain: Evan Seinfeld]
I question not me, it only happens to others
I can't deny reality as life gets smothered

[Verse 1: Evan Seinfeld & Billy Graziadei]
If the lines can be read between
Maybe you can tell me then what it all means
'Cause he who paints the big picture runs the whole scene
Locked down, I gotta get it out
Impending doom, a cloud above my head
Why me? My faith has been devout
Blasphemous? Am I better off dead?

Has me full of pity for all of humankind

In my eyes, who really pays the price

Bustin' my ass, another day another dollar
As I kneel down and I confess to the father
That I'm suffering a burning question of the truth

But now I'm positive and life - it all ends

In reality, we all must face the fact
That the majority of the people are out there smoking crack
Getting doped up, shooting that shit into their veins
The question must be asked if we have any brains left

A question we all ask and must answer before long
'Cause no one is safe in this world, what's the deal?

[Bridge: Doodlebug]
Jazz, in the last 5 years has progressed in its fits
And starts of sudden discoveries and
Startled reactions. New principles, new sounds
New rhythms and harmonies have been advanced with unusual frequency
Not surprisingly, many of the younger musicians have been quietly digesting
This information almost as quickly as it has appeared
As a result, they've acquired a degree of
Musical sophistication which supersedes many of the previous standards of excellence
So it's no longer especially relevant to ask the young saxophone player
For example, to demonstrate his ability by running through all the Charlie Parker licks

Stash a fat gat cause the loops let you dig

phish,scent of a mule,1994,"Scent of a Mule Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Kitty Malone sat on a mule
Was riding in style
When suddenly, like the sound of a buzzard’s breaking
Kitty felt laser beams being fired at her head
She said, ""I hate laser beams
And you never done see me askin’, mhm-mmm
For a UFO, for a UFO, for a UFO
In Tomahawk County""
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well she kicked the mule and it walked the path
And the aliens fired from behind
'Til she stopped the mule and she kicked the rump
Then the big old mule took a big old dump

[Chorus]
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
Take your laser beams away
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
You better stop that laser game

[Post-Chorus]
Or you'll smell my mule

[Verse 2]
She felt the fire against her neck
And it saddened her to feel it burn
When suddenly, like the sound of a breeding Holstein
Kitty said, ""Stop, we ain’t lookin’ for a-fightin’
In Tomahawk County""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well a little guy from the UFO
Came on out and said his name was Joe
She said, ""Come on over for some lemonade
Just follow me now with the whole brigade""
[Chorus]
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
Take your laser beams away
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
You better stop that laser game

[Post-Chorus]
Or you'll smell my mule

[Instrumental Break]
Yeehaw!

[Verse 3]
They walked into her cabin shack
They had never seen a southern home
And they liked it, better than the UFO
They liked it, they really liked it

[Bridge]
They said, ""Here’s a place of elegance
Here we shower ourselves in lightness""
""Here’s a place of elegance (huh-huh-huh)
Here we shower ourselves in lightness"" (huh-huh-huh)
""Here’s a place of elegance (huh-huh)
Here we shower ourselves in lightness"" (huh-huh-huh)
""Here’s a place of elegance (huh-huh-huh)

Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
Take your laser beams away
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
You better stop that laser game

Police in the city
Is shuttin all the clubs down
It's lookin like a ghost town
Ya know Mary- what we gotta do?
Hell Yeah!
We gotta go underground""
To da place -from which we all came from
House parties-they was always fun
Remember tryin to rig a sound system
Everybody- would bring a donation
When we needed- to get a turn table
My man Zulu
Would borrow one from aunt Mable
Set it up in the corner-
Turn the lights down until the mornin'
(chorus)
But the party ain't started till the speaker's blown
NO! NO! NO!
Run fa ya life!
The party ain't started 'till the speaker's blown

While he was settin up camp
Someone else would bring a home stereo amp
With a note from they mama-
""don't turn it up loud or it's a goner""
Sorry mama- there's no chance
Cause if the shit ain't bumpin'
People ain't gonna dance
""know what I'm sayin'"" (""Turn that shit up"")
Everybody in the place would bring a few speakers
String em all togetha like they was sneakers
And say a prayer- before we turn it on
Hopin that the amp- wouldn't get blown
I asked Mary watcha think of it
""now we need a D.J. to work this shit""
So everybody- would bring a few singles- get
The beat bumpin
And then start to mingle

(chorus)
Every woman every man wanna move dem feet
Every woman every man love a Spearhead beat!
Every brother and every sister
Would pay respect up to the ancestors
We would dance and we would celebrate
Even though we live in a police state
Then the pigs- would try to make a statement
With a ticket- for noise abatement
But we kept it pumpin' -till the braekadawn
Then we told the cops
They gotta break the door down
And today -across the nation- don't ya know
It's the same situation
Alotta cities lookin like a ghost town
But the house party will never be shut down
No no no!

Every woman every man wanna move dem feet
Every woman every man love a Spearhead beat!

Fall back again
Fall back again
Fall back again
Fall back again

Oh, life, it seems a struggle between what we think, what we see
I'm not going to change my ways just to please you or appease you
Inside a crowd, five billion proud, willing to punch it out
Right, wrong, weak, strong, ashes to ashes, all fall down
I look around about this round about this merry-go-round around
If at all God's gaze upon us fall, his mischievous grin, look at him
Forget about the reasons and the treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that our emotions can be swept away
Forget about being guilty, we are innocent instead
For soon we will all find our lives swept away

Oh, sit a while with TV's hungry child, big belly swelled
Oh, for a price of a Coke or a smoke, keep alive those hungry eyes
Take a look at me, what you see in me, mirror look at me
Face it all, face it all again

Forget about the reasons and the treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that our emotions can be swept away, kept at bay
Forget about being guilty, I am innocent instead
For soon we will all find our lives swept away

You seek up an emotion and our cup is overflowing
You see up an emotion, sometimes your well is dry
You seek up a big monster for him to fight your wars for you
But when he find his way to you, the devil's not going
Ha, ha
Ha, ha

Say
Oh, say

Look at me and my fancy car and my bank account
Oh, how I wish I could take it all down into my grave, I'd save
Take a look again, take a look again, take a look again
Everyday things change, basically they stay the same
Forget about the reasons and the treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that our emotions can be swept away
Intentions are not wicked, don't be tricked into thinking so
Soon we will all find our lives swept away

You seek up an emotion and your cup is overflowing
You seek up an emotion, sometimes your well is dry
You seek up a big monster for him to fight your wars for you
But when he finds his way to you, the devil's not going

But to ignite and put in flight my sense of militance

She thanks her Jesus for the daises and the roses

Someday she'll understand the meaning of it all

As close as a heartbeat or a song on her lips
Someday she'll trust Him and learn how to see Him
Someday He'll call her and she will come running
And fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and she'll pray

The sermon echoes through the walls
A great salvation through it calls to the people
Who stare into nowhere, and can't feel the chains on their souls

The picture at hand at what we do best
You see the mark is a chart, the rap is our art
So rise from your slumber, we came here to rock!

Right about this time!

We'll make ya shake and shiver
The devastatin' rhymes we can deliver
And ya sucka MCs, to us you're a minus
We dominate the charts because we are the world finest

And ya convicted to jail, now here's your lesson
Stetsasonic, a name you will never forget
[Daddy-O]
But if you can't say it all!

[All]
Just Say Stet!

[Daddy-O]
Never were we meant to be ordinary
The way we rap is unique and legendary
Exquisitely masked, Stetsa, terrific
Premiere as a group or should I be specific
Delite, Daddy-O, and the D.B.C
Frukwan, and Paul, and the Mix Machine
And I won't fret, if you take it as a threat
But if you can't say it all!

[All]
Just Say Stet!

[Delite]
Now when I come wit it, wit style it and prolific
No friction to our diction, strictly scientific
Before we leave, young ladies will be pleased
As we shock the house, before I enter at breeze
'Cause Stetsa means loud, and sonic means sound
And this is the name that's gonna be around
So let the name reflect and get it correct

Precision on the mix is the kid named Prince
The one beat king by the cut, he evicts

And slicker than slick, fresher than fresh
Mix Machine Wise is sure to press

And we're the MCs, that hail from the East

So it's straight to the floor, get ya butts off the wall
And rock with Wise, and the one Prince Paul

""Remain seated, please. Permanecer sentados, por favor""

[Verse 1]
Once was a magical place
Over time, it was lost
Price increased the cost
Now the fortune of the kingdom
Is locked up in its dungeon vaults
The castle floor lies in traps
With coiled wires set back
Decoyed by old cheese
Now the drawbridge has been lifted
As the millions, they drop to their knees
[Pre-Chorus]
They pay homage to a king
Whose dreams are buried in their minds
His tears are frozen stiff
Icicles drip from his eyes

[Verse 2]
The cold wind blows as it snows
On those who fight to get in
On heads that are small
Disillusioned (Disillusioned) as they enter (As they enter)
They're unaware what's behind castle walls
But now it's written in stone
The king has been overthrown by jesterly fools
And the power (And the power) of the people (Of the people)
Shall come to believe they do rule

[Pre-Chorus]
They pay homage to a king
Whose dreams are buried in their minds
His tears are frozen stiff
Icicles drip from his eyes

[Chorus]
Welcome to the tragic kingdom
Cornfields of popcorn have yet to spring open
[Bridge]
Have they lost their heads
Or are they just all blind mice?
We've heard all their stories
One too many times
Hypnotized by fireflies that glow in the dark
And midgets that disguise themselves as tiny little dwarfs
The parade that's electrical
It serves no real purpose
Just takes up a lot of juice
Just to impress us

Whose dreams are buried in their minds
His tears are frozen stiff

john prine,lake marie,1995,"Lake Marie LyricsWe were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa ah oh ah oh

Many years ago along the Illinois-Wisconsin border
There was this Indian tribe
They found two babies in the woods, white babies
One of them was named Elizabeth
She was the fairer of the two
While the smaller and more fragile one was named Marie
Having never seen white girls before
And living on the two lakes known as the Twin Lakes
They named the larger and more beautiful lake, Lake Elizabeth
And thus the smaller lake that was hidden from the highway
Became known forever as Lake Marie
We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa ah oh ah oh

Many years later, I found myself talking to this girl
Who was standing there with her back turned to Lake Marie
The wind was blowing especially through her hair
There was four Italian sausages cooking on the outdoor grill
And they was s-s-sizzlin'
Many years later we found ourselves in Canada
Trying to save our marriage and perhaps catch a few fish
Whatever came first
That night, she fell asleep in my arms
Humming the tune to 'Louie Louie'
Aah baby, we gotta go now

We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa ah oh ah oh
Whoa ah oh ah oh

The dogs were barking as the cars were parking
The loan sharks were sharking, the narcs were narcing
Practically everyone was there
In the parking lot by the forest preserve
The police had found two bodies
Nay, naked bodies!
Their faces had been horribly disfigured by some sharp object
Saw it on the news, the TV news in a black and white video
You know what blood looks like in a black and white video?
Shadows, shadows! That's what it looks like
All the love we shared between her and me was slammed
Slammed up against the banks of old Lake Marie, Marie
We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa ah oh ah oh
Whoa ah oh ah oh

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear
That something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
[Verse 2]
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared
To take a look, at the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Verse 3]
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

That something's always near

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

To put the Glock to work

Taking that life is like taking a shit
Hit or miss, niggas are playing God
Trying to rob and steal
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill
Like a barbecue cause them harming you
Are just like honeybees swarming you
Vocally arming you was my responsibility
It's killing me thinking that all these niggas see they flauging
Thinking they Steven Seagal and balling
Falling to the wayside when ya try to call, I've fallen
When we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
Still yet they tend to flex, like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing, no-no, not this time

Cause there might not be another soon
Holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars
Tightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker

But little do you know that even Joe got problems that he gots to joust with
Floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel
In this race oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch that be in heat
I'm on the beat like cops
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why? Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things
Maybe the mockingbird and nightingale they want to sing
Keeping this thing alive, to the table's what we bring

[Verse  1: Slimkid3]
Beam me-beam me-beam me up, Scotty
Not as to where I have no control of my body
Tweaking diodes I walk the roads like karate masters
Most the time my mind be ghost like Casper sinkin faster
But coming up in this shit sometimes I'm alienated, underrated
Suckas hate it that I made it as a misfit
But you know if the shoe fits I'mma wear it like a glass slipper
Hike to the big dipper, dip like a skipper, no top could be tipper (say what?)
But fools be tryin to rape friends to make friends
And that's one big twisted ass picture
Like Jack the Ripper
Caught up in the net like Flipper on a tuna protest, yeah, where's the focus
Got me fuckin with these friends and they crackin' my lens
And now, shit be'z foul as a mutha
Word to my sistas and my brothas and my color
[Hook 2x]
""Hey you""
Can I take up a moment of your precious time
To realize and define the whole truth
""Hey you""
Yeah take up a moment and clarify this for you

[Verse 2: Imani]
Because of my high altitude, the attitude of this one dude
Was just so lewd that he was viewed as rude and pursued by the Cyde
He was booed and chewed like food in the feud
Ending a career way shorter than an interlude and dude
The word I heard is that your vision is blurred
That's why you be speakin' the word so absurd, but
You get exactly what you deserve
As I hit and you swerve to hit the curb
Cuz you be totally guilty of the filthy-type phrasing
Faltering for sure under pressure
Overhyped and unamazing

[Hook 4x]

Instructions are as follow
Don't try to follow
Nor swallow, nor bite
Nor nibble, what I write
You know what time this is, that shit ain't right

You know what I'm sayin my man Schmooche Cat
You know what I'm sayin my legacy

Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

In this whole world, what is fair?

Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

I love her more than my favorite two bands/
What if I got 2 bands? /
4 bands? 6 bands? I’m paying for a keg stand/
With a handle in my left hand/
Pouring drinks for my friends then/
I’m puffing out my chest and/
3 shots for Yung Dyl and he’s draining more than Stephen/
I walk in the Cabin and when I look at Kint/
She lights my heart on fire like she is a pack of flints/
Then all in all, I’m all in/
First day on the field; you call me Squints/
No show, that must be the consequence/
Trying to get the extra condiments/

Yo, RIP to my homie Richie/

Thinkin' life is big, is that hip is it norm
Psych-e-delic and fat
Flowers and beads and peaces and naps
Ah yes, planets got the blessed
Beats are played on Friday to get Monday off your chest
Kick live dig into the quotes
Lose yourself and groove in the beauty as it floats
Hair, clothes monochrome it ain't
Many different worlds in the sweet and funky joint
Pounds, hands speakers and jams
Even those that flams get fitted in the plans
Light, years sugar for your ears

We know, yes, we know
I set my ego on fantastic
But still, you're fuckin' with my plastic
Dedicated, medicated they bend and break me
Overrate me
I take a small piece, make it breathe
It takes a second to wreck it, sucka niggas won't believe
They stress me, test me, vex me
So what? You got a gun? That shit don't impress me
Yes, yes, you always walk with the crew
Yo back the fuck up cause you're not alone
If you don't think I'm a brother, then check my chromosome
Brand new, you're retro
I already passed you on a one-two
I've been cued to this already
Bullet to the head
Bullet to the head, what you know I's joking?
What the fuck you doin'?
You gonna represent my intention?
You need more than a mic and a mention
Through the scars you see bars
Through the bars you see scars, results of my rage

Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro

[Verse 2: Martina Topley-Bird]
Scared to skip and step in case you trip and fall
Thunder picks you up, slaps you on the wall
That's maniacal, I cuff through my manacle
Mechanical, I'm super-natty
Love is not talk, I walk on by
Exotic spices
If your mouth can't tame the meaning
Be careful of the faces you're seeing
A dread of the past and fear of the future
That's maniacal, I cuff through my manacle
Mechanical, I'm super-natty

suzanne vega,the queen and the soldier,1985,"The Queen and the Soldier LyricsThe soldier came knocking upon the queen's door
He said, ""I am not fighting for you any more""
And the queen knew she'd seen his face someplace before
And slowly she let him inside

He said, ""I've watched your palace up here on the hill
And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will
Only first I am asking you why.""

Down in the long narrow hall he was led
Into her rooms with her tapestries red
And she never once took the crown from her head
She asked him there to sit down
He said, ""I see you now, and you are so very young
But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
And now will you tell me why?""

Well the young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
She said, ""You won't understand, and you may as well not try""
But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry
But she closed herself up like a fan

And she said, ""I've swallowed a secret burning thread
It cuts me inside, and often I've bled""
He laid his hand then on top of her head
And he bowed her down to the ground

""Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed
But I won't march again on your battlefield""
And he took her to the window to see

And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray
And she wanted more than she ever could say
But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away
And would not look at his face again

And he said, ""I want to live as an honest man
To get all I deserve and to give all I can
And to love a young woman who I don't understand
Your highness, your ways are very strange.""
But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break
And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
She would only be a moment inside

Out in the distance her order was heard
And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word
And while the queen went on strangeling in the solitude she preferred
The battle continued on2Embed",0.122,0.785,0.092,-0.9451

Could've given you everything that you need
But I cannot turn back the years
The perfect love was all you wanted from me
But I cannot turn back the years

[Chorus: Phil Collins]
So we have to be strong, and I'm finding that hard
We have to move on, but no matter how hard I try
If your heart's in pieces, you look for the truth
And when I look deep down inside I know, it's too bad I love you
Too bad I love you
[Verse 2: Phil Collins]
Sometimes hits me in the morning, hits me at night
That I cannot turn back the years
So I look out my window, turn off my light
But I cannot turn back the years
Can't make it seem easy, when you're all that I see
Can't live in a dream and I won't serenade the truth
People are hurting and they're looking to me
And I look at you there's nothing more to say, it's too bad I love you

[Bridge: Phil Collins]
But I'm never going to (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
No i love you and I'm never going to (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
I'll keep holding on to you (give it up)
(Give it up, give it up)
And i'm never going to give it up
(Give it up, give it up)

All that I lived for, all that I dreamed
But I cannot turn back the years
You're the water I drink, you're the air that I breathe
But I cannot turn back the years

So we have to be strong, and I'm finding that hard
We have to move on, but no matter how hard I try
If your heart's in pieces, you look for the truth

And it's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doin' for us?
And I'm givin' all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothin's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take, but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse
See, woah, it's a crazy world we're livin' in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these

For useless twisting, all the new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground

Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties of Earth that man has made
And now every mother can choose the colour
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well, that's what they said yesterday
There's nothin' left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane to synthesize another strain

Bruised and scraped ya

But those are just lies
'Cause in your eyes
You've been victimized
It's how you size it up

You disguise it up
And try to make it look real
To cover up the low self esteem you feel

Introspection, an afterthought
Swimmin' in guilt's your favorite sport
But now you're caught up in the undertow
You never knew a man could sink so low

But now you know
'Cause you're John Doe
In a black bag

But got no one to blame

Cause in the life they're living, you can't half step

And if you ain't down, you'll get played out son
So let's get a car, you know, a fly whip
Get a dent puller, screwdriver and be off quick
With a dope ride, yeah, and a rowdy crew
We can bag us a Benz and an Audi, too
Even a jeep or a van, goddamn, we're getting ours, yo
Take a trip up the strip, and be like stars so
It doesn't matter if the cops be scoping
They can't do jack, that's why a young brother's hopin'
To do anything, anywhere, anyplace

They might say we're a menace to society
But at the same time I say ""Why is it me?""
Am I the target, for destruction?
What about the system, and total corruption?

I got some talent, so don't you get my point?
I'll organize some brothers and get some crazy loot
Selling D-R-U-G-S and clocking dollars, troop
Cause the phat dough, yo, that suits me fine
I gotta have it so I can leave behind
The mad poverty, never having always needing
If a sucker steps up, then I leave him bleeding
I gotta get mine, I can't take no shorts
And while I'm selling, here's a flash report
Organized crime, they get theirs on the down low
Here's the ticket, wanna bet on a horse show?
You gotta be a pro, do what you know

Got the tenth one kneeling, let me express my feelings
Guru has never been one to play a big shot
It's just the styles I got that keep my mic hot
And fuck turning my back to the street scene
It gives me energy, so I'mma keep fiends
Coming, just to get what I'm selling

So keep abreast to the Gang Starr conquest

I was nineteen, I'd do anything
Shit like that now scares me, but I'd like to do it again

First to flow, Nick, oh my brother, so wise, and then I rise
Nick, he is an ill kid pimpin' 'cause he is so slick

Then boomin' like thunder in a cosmic jungle
Death defyin' like Evil Knievel
Words that will wobble, awkwards and evil

'Cause he flow and rock the hardest of the crowds
A marvel pow, how you like me now
I've returned the kiss of death, the last Damien
From the abyss, a fresh eternal alien
Now famished from pathless ways, I'm-a do damage
To the wack MCs, I know you can't stand this
Right about now, get down, I'm the annihilator
Rockin' with the rhythm of my rhyme detonator

Underneath a dark cloud couldn't find the blue
And I wasn't sure quite what to do
I wore my heart upon my sleeve

Disappointed I could not believe at last
That I had finally shaken off the past with you
I don't know how you trapped me
All I know is now I'm happy

Let me reveal
All the feelings that I feel

Till you came along and your love made me ring
Now it's only you for whom I sing
If I wrote you a different song each day

Still I know I never could repay your love
Falling like an angel from above to me
And now I'm never lonely, no
Now it's forever only you

Killing a criminal justice subliminal
Fear of the zero number line progression
Walking to the positive Hiv negative
Attitude positive Haters negative
Thanks for the points you jus powering my flow
By force will take it lost sheep recovery
Destroying poverty blocking polygamy
Mercury chemistry you and me will never be
Me and Jesus absorb my weakness
Destined for greatness life with no curses
Everything for show nothing under censoring
Harder in prayer not hard in the paint
Christian rapping it doesn't mean I am a saint
Believing seer not a seer to believe
Call this apocalypse 2012 airships
My God so gracious given are the chances
Translate to Chinese wolves in disguises
Too many spices can't make you Indian x 5
Yeah jus give me a chance to freak you out

Listen closely I hope you understand controlling your mind thats the meaning of Devil
Mind controlling you cos you lack wisdom
Child abuses through a drug like alcohol

To trigger the mind of a 21st slave

Snow so white and that chick in wonderland
Seraphim Seraphim ah burning all the fires
Picture me with Chist pressing all the shutters
Wounds causing traumas creating all the monsters
Silly heartbreak now you are part of the players
Screaming outloud I have so many haters
Speaking of haters you killed my Messiah
Spoiled little John's head on a plater

I was surprised, I was happy for a day in 1975
I was puzzled by a dream, it stayed with me all day in 1995
My brother had confessed he was gay
It took the heat off me for a while
He stood up with a sailor friend
Made it known upon my sister's wedding day

[Verse 2]
I got married in a rush to save a kid from being deported
Now she's in love
Oh, I was so touched, I was moved to kick the crutches from my crippled friend
She was not impressed 'cause I cured her on the Sabbath
I went to confess
When she saw the funny side, we introduced my child bride
To whisky and gin, to whisky and gin
[Verse 3]
The priest in the booth had a photographic memory
For all he had heard
He took all of my sins and he wrote a pocket novel called The State That I Am In
So I gave myself to God
There was a pregnant pause before he said ok
Now I spend my day turning tables round in Marks & Spencer
They don't seem to mind

[Chorus]
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in

[Verse 4]
Oh, love of mine, would you condescend to help me?
'Cause I am stupid and blind
Oh, and desperation is the Devil's work, it is the folly of a boy's empty mind
Oh, and now I'm feeling dangerous, riding on city buses for a hobby is sad
Why don't you lead me to a living
And I promise that I'd entertain my crippled friend
My crippled friend

In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber

The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing

Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite

I'm playin' in between the sheets in my jeep
Lookin' for the freak with the big butt cheeks
No disrespect throw your hands up
Yeah, grab your girl tell her, put her hands up
[Hook: Dae Day](Repeat 4X)
Throw your hands in the air
Put your blunts in the sky
Grab a cutie-pie
And do the butterfly

[Verse 2]
Cruisin' down the Ave, just to hit a spot
I got a fat girl on my jock
I'm a tell you why I'm the king and you're a peon
See what's happenin' your whole style is a rewind
Whack MCs will get verbally shot
Cause ain't no style like the style I got
I'm the idiotic kid that they call Bizarre
Get kick out at topless bars because I went too far
Don't try to roll if you're a beginner roll a rookie
Forget the blunts kid we high off weed-cookies
Buddha sets represent the mid-west
And I can penetrate trough vest
Leaving a whole lot of mess
Three millers and a blunt, boy I'm too high
Just cause I'm a big guy don't mean I can't butterfly
My crew's gettin' wasted in Noah's Arc
I'm in the back of the club smokin' blunts with Sonya Burnheart
Don't matter if your big short or tall
Kick your game and give your girl a call
The nights over kid, I'm still gettin' splifted
Keith Murray dropped the half off the set get lifted

I stumble in the night
Never really knew what it would've been like
You're no longer there to break my fall
The heartache over you
I'd give it everything but I couldn't live through
I never saw the signs
You're the last to know when love is blind

All the tears and the turbulent years
When I would not wait for no one
Didn't stop, take a look at myself
See me losing you
[Chorus]
When the lonely heart breaks, it's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more than the fire that will roar
A hole in my soul
For you it's good-bye, for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls, for me

[Verse 2]
Seen you in a magazine
A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been
Hanging on the arm of someone else
I'm still in love with you
Won't you come back to your little boy blue
I've come to feel inside
This precious love was never mine

Now I know but a little too late
That I could not live without you
In the dark or the broad daylight
I promise I'll be there

When I couldn't reach out to no one

Are you leaving me a helpless child

You worry too much
You make yourself sad
You can't change fate
But don't feel so bad
Enjoy it while you can
It's just like the weather
So quit complaining, brother
No one lives forever!

[Chorus]
Let's have a party
There's a full moon in the sky
It's the hour of the wolf
And I don't want to die
I'm so happy
Dancin' while the grim reaper
Cuts, cuts, cuts
But he can't get me
I'm as clever as can be
And I'm very quick, but don't forget
We've only got so many tricks
No one lives forever!
[Verse 2]
You think you got it rough? (Rough)
What about your darling doggy?
Ten short years
He's getting old and groggy
I don't think it's very fair
Cold, chop, low
But it's all relative, my friend
No one lives forever!

[Chorus]
Let's have a party
There's a full moon in the sky
It's the hour of the wolf
And I don't want to die
I'm so happy
Dancin' while the grim reaper
Cuts, cuts, cuts
But he can't get me
I'm as clever as can be
And I'm very quick, but don't forget
We've only got so many tricks
No one lives forever!

[Instrumental bridge]
Hey!
Oh (Oh)
[Verse 1 reprise]
You worry too much
You make yourself sad (sad)
You can't change fate
But don't feel so bad
Enjoy it while you can
It's just like the weather
So quit complaining, brother (brother)
No one lives forever!

[Abbreviated Chorus]
Let's have a party
There's a full moon in the sky
It's the hour of the wolf
And I don't wanna die

[Verse 3]
No one beats him at his game
For very long, but just the same
Who cares there's no place safe to hide?
Nowhere to run, no time to cry
So celebrate while you still can
'Cause any second, it may end
And when it's all been said and done
Better that you had some fun
Instead of hiding in your shell
Why make your life a living hell?
So drink a toast and down the cup
And drink to bones that turn to dust, 'cause
No one, no one, no one, no one
No one, no one, no one, no one
No one, no one, no one, no one
No one lives forever!

Rotten scum has found its way to power
Time to protect projects, check the hour
I'm fed worse than just angry
Ready for action, baby
Not gettin' lazy, not goin' crazy
Cause I'mma make something happen
Not when just a member when I'm rappin'
For real, and it's amazing to me
How suckas be hopelessly fakin' to be
Somebody on-point and influential
Yet they got no talent and never had no potential
Cause they lack the bear essential
Strength of the mental, the soulful vocals
Crushing all you ugly oculs
People try to rate me like I'm the pulse
But then they find that I'm the most
Too complex when I'm vexed
And right about now I'mma wreck your game
Yeah, this is the season for a change
[Hook - Guru](2X)
This is the season, this is the season
This is the season, for a change

[Verse 2 - Guru]
And if this is offensive than take it personal
You start to squint from my lines and so I'm hurtin' you
But I ain't on no mission to be wishin' you no bad luck
I put you down, so you know what's up
You need to change your perspective
Peep the rhyme, that's corrective, selective
To speak facts that's my objective
I mess with a little bit of this flow and that if
And then the little bit start to sound fat, and
S-M-double-O-T-H
Believe me, the feeling yo it's worth to wait
But I still can't stand those, who try to front
Because they soft as butter rolls
A kid gets a gun, he feels he needs one
Either he shoots one or else he gets done
And what's the purpose of this tragic outcome
It's always easier to shift the blame
But ehm this is the season for a change

[Hook](3X)
[Verse 3 - Guru]
You cosmetic freak your style is weak and cornballed
And even worse when you speak
I put a lid on it and sit on it a bit
Don't even do it to yourself
Just be glad you got your health
Cut the bull, stop the nonsense
You're tryin' to get props under false pretense
But I came just to wreck ya game
This is the season for a change

Awakened, I have become
Light now slips away
Manipulate your mind
Darkness is my slave
Taste the sins of Hell
The blood that I so crave
The last thing that you see
Is the hunger in my eyes

[Chorus]
Blood sucking creatures of the night
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light
Cries screaming out every fright
Eagerly awaiting plight
Apparitions from the pits of Hell
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell
Demented lust, the secrets they must keep
Addicted to your blood
At dawn they sleep

Unveil the hidden coffin
Lift the lid of terror
Feel the deadly cold
Freeze you from inside
Perceiving your intentions
To slay the phantom form
Raise the stake in malice
You cannot plunge it down

Blood sucking creatures of the night
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light
Cries screaming out every fright
Eagerly awaiting plight

Addicted to your blood
At dawn they sleep

Beware the image unseen
Stalks your soul
Your corpse's redeem
Eternal damnation, your just reward
A servant of our Lord
By your accord
Admonish of the cruciform
Impalement
Immortality's scorned
Rise, hold fast your faith
To lie dormant
Is certain death

Driven by the instinct of centuries of horror
Implanted along the brain of the sickening parasite
Linked together by one trait
The hell-ful need to kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill

[Outro]
Emerging from their hellish tomb
Taking flight amidst the night
The evening skies are raining death
Swooping down from shadowed skies
Taking simple human form
Shed their wings to stalk the mortal man
Lock their jaws into your veins
Satanic soldiers strike their prey
Leaving corpses waiting for the change
Blood dripping from the jaws of death
Not enough to satisfy
They must drain your soul of life

It's the fear so unclear
Man in motion going nowhere
In our homes stuck in the face
Spread the word to the populace
Yellow journal, yellow journal
Set the pace, feel the rage
Manifestations of a sort
So insidious off the point
Simple solution, never confusion
Sport a gun, kill a cop
Crazy world of weary thought
So receive me had enough
Lock me up, lock me up

Is he who speaks isn't weak

Bubonic plague, the truth of aids
Immunity avoid decay
In the trench of pestilence
The bible screams announce your faith
Mutterings of death to bring
Suffocate a newborn thing

Inflatable as propaganda

All prefer no one blames
The terror in an animal's screams
In cages our future
The answers insane

Right here in America all so used to keepin score
Afraid to come to the table with a hand that might not win

I hope I won't let you down
If you give me a chance I'll try

The road I'm traveling on
And if I take your hand
I might lead you down the path to ruin

I walk the streets alone
On feeble bones I ride
My sins are etched in stone
I got no place to hide

Well, I was unshakable
In what I did believe
I feel so breakable
But have I been deceived
You showed me your paradise
And your carnival of souls
But my heart keeps telling me
That ain't the place to go

Well, I'm not invincible
So I want you to leave
Well, I'm so convincible
But have I been deceived

When things were black and white
Never thought I'd get confused
On what was wrong and right

As long as I know that you know

Looking for something forever gone
But something we will always want

Slips her dress like a flag to the floor

Beginning is hyped when you playin in the bars
A bottomless pit where you make loose and far
Take away your privacy and take your guitar
Then take your woman and impound your car

My beginning of wisdom
I won't take you too far

To be a superstar
Baby if you got it forget about that
Your money don't concern you that's a natural fact
Shut up your mouth before you get knocked down
We're gonna listen to your voice upon the speaker box

First you get a manager but what does he do
I'll be the first to tell you baby that I don't have a clue
We're gunna make a phony image for the MTV
Hear it on the radio say, ""Damn that's me""

Whenever I get over on a 3 peice harm

Put your ass in the john to be a superstar

You'd see the day you'd act like this

And then it goes around the world

Thank you, thank you, thank you. I'd just like to say before we start off with the concert, that, uh, to thank you all for coming here, and, uh, as you all know, it's a special benefit concert. We've got a good show lined up. I hope so, anyway. First part of the concert is gonna be an Indian music section. You're gonna hear a sitar and sarood duet. And, uh, as you realize, Hindi music's a little bit more serious than our music, and I'd appreciate it if you could, uh, try and settle down and get into the Hindi music section. So let me introduce, on sitar, Ravi Shankar. And the master of sarood, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. Sarood. I'm sure you all know Ravi's tabla player, Allah Rakha. And this evening, the drone instrument, the tamboora, is being played by Kamala. So I hope you enjoy the concert, thank you

RAVI SHANKAR:
Tamboora. Friends, as George told you just now, they will be participating in the second part. The first part is going to be us playing for you on the Indian instruments, the Indian music. This is a type of music which needs a little concentrated listening. And I would request you to have little patience. I know you are very impatient to hear your favorite stars, who will be in the second part, but we are trying to set the music to this special event, this historical program, which is just not a program as usual but which has a message. And this is to just make you aware of a very serious situation that is happening. We are not trying to make any politic. We are artists, but through our music, we would like you to feel the agony and also the pain and lot of sad happenings in Bangladesh, and also the refugees who have come to India. We will play a dhun, which means an air or a melody, which is based on a folk tune of Bangladesh. And after that we'll play a gat, a fast gat in teentaal of 16 beats. Now, as usual, I would request you, my friends, to refrain or stop from smoking, while the program is on. Thank you very muchEmbed",0.047,0.824,0.129,0.9756

[Verse 1]
Hello, me, meet the real me and my misfits way of life
A dark, black past is my most valued possession
Hindsight is always 20-20
But looking back, it's still a bit fuzzy
Speak of mutually assured destruction
Nice story, tell it to Reader's Digest

[Chorus 1]
Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me and my air is getting thin
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm chomping at the bit and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets
[Verse 2]
Hello, me, it's me again
You can subdue, but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache, sinking down to your level
Yeah, just keep on thinking it's my fault
And stay an inch or two out of kicking distance
Mankind has got to know his limitations

[Chorus 2]
Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I don't know where I've been
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm sharpening the axe and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets

Someday, you too, will know my pain
And smile its black-toothed grin
If the war inside my head won't take a day off, I'll be dead
My icy fingers claw your back
Here I come again

See it in the faces of the people everyday
We need to take control and find some ammo right away
Our cause is righteous and we're gonna have our say
Get ready for the judgement day

Families are breaking up cause underpaids can't make ends meet
The establishment has put their money underground
Cause they all know what's coming down

A lucky precious few with money in their banks
Can't imagine what it's like to find yourself in homeless ranks
They've got no conscience for the ones who won't survive
The time for payback has arrived

john mellencamp,minutes to memories,1985,"Minutes to Memories LyricsOn a Greyhound thirty miles beyond Jamestown
He saw the sun set on the Tennessee line
He looked at the young man who was riding beside him
He said I'm old kind of worn out inside
I worked my whole life in the steel mills near Gary
And my father before me I helped build this land
Now I'm seventy-seven and with God as my witness
I earned every dollar that passed through my hands
My family and friends are the best thing I've known
Through the eye of the needle I'll carry them home
Days turn to minutes and minutes to memories
Life sweeps away the dreams that we have planned
You are young and you are the future
So suck it up and tough it out and be the best you can

The rain hit the old dog in the twilight's last gleaming
He said Son it sounds like rattling old bones
This highway is long but I know some that are longer
By sunup tomorrow I guess I'll be home
Through the hills of Kentucky 'cross the Ohio river
The old man kept talking 'bout his life and his times
He fell asleep with his head against the window
He said an honest man's pillow is his peace of mind
This world offers riches and riches will grow wings
I don't take stock in those uncertain things

Days turn to minutes and minutes to memories
Life sweeps away the dreams that we have planned
You are young and you are the future
So suck it up and tough it out and be the best you can

The old man had a vision but it was hard for me to follow
I do things my way and I pay a high price
When I think back on the old man and the bus ride
Now that I'm older I can see he was right
Another hot one out on highway eleven
This is my life It's what I've chosen to do
There's no free rides, no one said it'd be easy
The old man told me this my son i'm telling it to you

It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose

I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot

And you see what I’m hunting a few steps away

The course that my tread had already traversed

Invaded through what was an unguarded seam
The torrent of helplessness swept me away
To the cavern of shame and the hall of dismay

How did we manage to destroy?
Is this the best we got?
Is this the best we got?

How should I feel, about all the fucking noises in my head?
With the inflicted guilt to carry all this weight?
I guess I have to, I guess I really have to
Even though I don’t know how… yet

Adapt, adapt, seeking for joy and finding emptiness, seek happiness
Take drugs, break out and suffer from depression
Advertising, billboards, everlasting state of overstimulation
Eat, work, fuck, consume at best without breathing
Count us as lost
And we run faster when we lost our way
Count us as lost
We cannot hide, there is nothing left
Count us as lost
A crown on top and one foot in the grave
Count us as lost

How should I feel, about all the fucking problems in this world?
Every single step you make, every single breath you take
Will leave an impact I have to erase!

Get more, get more, driven by greed, were destroying mother earth
Don’t hope don’t hope, I want you to be afraid
CO2, climate change, hurricanes, tidal waves, extinction level events…
Running into apocalypse, at least with heads held high

Count us as lost
And we run faster when we lost our way
Count us as lost
A crown on top and one foot in the grave
Count us as lost
We cannot hide, there is nothing left
Count us as lost

Work, work, rat race, wait for orders from above
Basic rights, hollow phrases, whistleblower…
Terrorists, poverty, hunger crisis, refugees, time pressure, holidays
Profitable professional slaves
Count us as lost
And we run faster when we lost our way
Count us as lost
We cannot hide, there is nothing left

The emcee serial killer, that's right, I'm back again
Stronger than the force flex trash bags I pack you in
Asking him to tone it down, don't make him laugh
Acid trip dope, never scared to swing an ax
I fall about as often as Tebow completes a pass
So polished and sheen, my technique's complete in fact
If you ever come at me trying to start a war
Not only does that make your decision making poor
I diss so sharp an incision's made in your throat
I reach inside and plug my mic into your vocal chords
They scream for more horrorcore, similar
To Shady before he sobered up, so what
If I'm that violent, how else can I be
When my favorite track from your favorite emcee is silence
So as many as be perfect, be thus minded
And since they tresspass against me, I'll stay criminal Minded

Find you in your basement or garage studio
Little did you know I belittle those wack flows
My unmatched wits are only rivaled by my pen
Illmaculate since I sat down and read
The Thesaurus and made a few corrections like juvi
You see emcees spit streams, that's why I'm in denial
About any threat to my pen, pad, and mic stand
I swear I could write a career ender with my left hand
Poker hand of Notorious, L, and Pun, I'm a big deal
I willed my skills into existence, I insist
You show respect where it's due
Never know what kind of damage could happen to you
This time, doubt you'd manage to pull through
Vanished with no remains except a stone for your tomb
Na, I don't do the cliche mic cord for a noose

This song is about feeling alone and it’s a big, big, big world, and not to be controversial but I want to dedicate this song to freedom in Palestine

[Verse 1]
He wears his heart safety pinned to his backpack
His backpack is all that he knows
Shot down by strangers whose glances can cripple
The heart and devour the soul

[Chorus]
All alone he turns to stone while holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what’s inside to save his life
He crawls like worm from a bird (oh, oh, oh)
Like worm from a bird
[Verse 2]
Out of his mind the wind pushes him whispering
Must have been out of his mind (out of his mind)
Mid-day delusions of pushing this out of his head
Maybe out of his mind

All alone he turns to stone while holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what’s inside to save his life
He crawls like worm
Like a worm from a bird (oh, oh, oh)
Like a worm from a bird (oh, oh, oh)
Worm from a bird (oh, oh, oh)
Crawls like worm
Like worm from a bird

Oh, oh

All he knows
If he can't relieve it, it grows
And so it goes (and so it goes)
He crawls like worm
Crawls like worm from the bird
He crawls a like
He crawls like a worm

Out of his mind  the wind pushes him whispering
Must have been out of his mind

It'd be absurd for you to think, you could serve like me
The big BL, nobody blew that herb like me
Straight out of CA, nobody know the curb like me
The curse might be, the gifts when you birth like g's
The first mic king, that CA seen since Mac Dre
Had tapes, servicing niggas that had papes
Had the jakes on my place, 3 days, had to shake
Threw the luggage at my brother, that's how you catch a case

I shot the sheriff no shutter
Close your blinds while I open mine
And let that California shine make a ho go blind
Before she blow yo' mind

Waking up in my city
A lot of angles, not an angel here to guide me
Living lost in these streets
Wouldn't advise you to come and find me
Ain't shit shiny, if anything is someone as grimy
Wonder how I see it everyday and still put it behind me
Stronger, top of the block, still walking through the bottom
Problems we got'em, funny, just wouldn't be the same without'em
It's the balance, can't challenge what it was already written
Is some truth, some proof
But the majority sit in my Caddy, Krysten, Crystal quiet(?)
Still hear them snakes, system, politic and they starting riots
My science sparks the ignition fire, burn

California coast line outline my poetry
Declare my dedication to my street hop openly
Potent throw-etry (floetry?) confidently confident
Smacking the incompetent with dominant doctrine
Devastating documents, documented in confidence
Manifested swag since I first started rocking shit
Hide from behind the trees in fatigue flow
Super back south central mental with my dome

And I can keep it up for as long as it takes
And it don't matter who you are

So, desperately, I sing to thee of love
Sure, but also of rage and hate and pain and fear of self
And I can't keep these feelings on the shelf
I've tried -- well, no, in fact, I lied
Could be financial suicide but I've got too much pride inside
To hide or slide I'll do as I'll decide
And let it ride until I've died
And only then shall I abide this tide
Of catchy little tunes
Of hip three minute ditties
I wanna bust all your balloons
I wanna burn all of your cities to the ground
I've found I will not mess around
Unless I play, then hey, I will go on all day
Hear what I say, I have a prayer to pray

The smile on their faces, it speaks of profound inner peace
Ask where they're going, they'll tell you nowhere

john mellencamp,rain on the scarecrow,1985,"Rain on the Scarecrow LyricsScarecrow on a wooden cross
Blackbird in the barn
Four hundred empty acres
That used to be my farm
Grew up like my daddy did
My grandpa cleared this land
When I was five
I walked the fence while Grandpa held my hand

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me proud
And son, I`m just sorry
There`s no legacy for you now
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

The crops we grew last summer
Weren`t enough to pay the loans
Couldn`t buy the seed to plant this spring
And the Farmers' Bank foreclosed
Called my old friend Schepman
Up to auction off the land
He said:
""John, it`s just my job
And I hope you understand.""
Hey, calling it your job, ole hoss
Sure don`t make it right
But if you want me to
I`ll say a prayer for your soul tonight
And grandma`s on the front porch swing
With a Bible in her hand
Sometimes I hear her singing
Take me to the Promised Land
When you take away a man`s dignity
He can`t work his fields and cows
There`ll be
Blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

There`s 97 crosses
Planted in the courthouse yard
Ninety-seven families who
Lost ninety-seven farms

I think about my grandpa
My neighbors and my name
And some nights
I feel like dying
Like that scarecrow in the rain

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me proud
And son, I`m just sorry
They`re just memories for you now

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me so proud
Son, I`m just sorry
They`re just memories for you now

Existing on damnation's edge
The priest had never known
To witness such a violent show
Of power overthrown
Angels fighting aimlessly
Still dying by the sword
Our legions killing all in sight
To get the one called Lord

The gates of Hell lie waiting, as you see
There's no price to pay, just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

He soon shall fall to me
Your souls are damned, your God has fell
To slave for me eternally

That Satan calls his home
Demons feed the furnace where
The dead are free to roam
Lonely children of the night
There's seven ways to go
Each leading to the burning hole
That Lucifer controls

Priests of Hades seek the sacred star
Satan sees the answer lies not far
Zombies, screaming souls, cry out to you
Satanic law prevails, your life is through

Death with you shall then abound
For what you seek for can't be found
In sea or sky or underground

Will bring you to your death

Stunts are a man's best friend
Ask any man, he'll say with a grin
Young or old, boys or men
Forty ounce or a glass of gin
Sitting in a club carrying a pen
Fronting with a girl every now and then
Scheming on a way to hit the skins
Stunts are a man's best friend
In the subway or riding in a Benz
Whether four eyes or contact lens
Sipping Moet or drinking Heineken
Some like dark, some like light-skinned
Some have one, and some have ten
Some still are and some have been
I'll play the rooster, you play the hen
Stunts are a man's best friend

Gotta put the herb in the blunt
You can use Bambú, if that's what you want
Only 50 cents, don't try to front
Hawaiian buds, yeah that's what I want
Doctors say your growth will stunt
If you smoke, but some say it's junk
Whether you're a trooper or some young punk
You gotta put the herb in the blunt
With the homeboy or chillin' with a stunt
Puffing on buddha, cess, or skunk
Gives a kick like a football punt
So much money has been spunt
Much much more than Donald Trump's
I hope my boom spot doesn't get bumped
As I listen to Thelonious Monk
I gotta put the herb in the blunt

So it seems sometimes that I grow weary (Isa. 40:29) and that the world around will overtake me. And all the things I pray just seem to float away as I stand alone I dream of you. Listening- For your voice to tell me where I should go. Listening- For your Word to teach me the wisdom I should know. Listening- For your light to shine the way through the darkest night (II Cor. 4:6). Listening- For comfort and love to feel all right (Ps. 119:50-52,76) Chorus: So now I'm listening for Your voice to softly call my name. I'm listening for Your voice to help me on my way. Yes I am listening for Your voice I long to hear You say ""My child I've come and here I'll stay."" It is the still small voice the man listens for, sometimes He shouts more time He whispers. 2X. For there are times in life I feel quite empty, and there are times when nothing will prevent me from striving day to day trying to find a way to a love I can only find in You, ya you. Listening- In moments, when I find it hard to hear you. Listening- Through the distractions of the World (I Jn. 2:16,17) Listening- I'm on my knees and begging you Lord please?

Listening- I find the solution in your Word. Chorus. Listen, It is the still small voice the man listens for sometimes He shouts more time He whispers. 2X. I want you to listen the tear from my eye well shines and glistens. God's Word is sweet as honey and it heals as medicine (Ps. 119:103, 107:20) It soothes my soul what the pastor says to do (Heb. 13:17) [He also speaks] Through your brothers and sisters and the mind of Christ in you. (I Cor. 2:16) So I want you to listen and to listen cleanly. With God's all seeing eyes you will see clearly that your day to day life it is just prophecy; to be fulfilled by God Almighty. Chorus.

bryan adams,have you ever really loved a woman?,1996,"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman? Lyrics[Verse 1]
To really love a woman
To understand her - You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
[Verse 2]
To really love a woman - Let her hold you
'Til you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Bridge]
Oh - You got to give her some faith - Hold her tight
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you
You really gotta love your woman

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman
[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

paul hardcastle,19,1985,"19 LyricsIn 1965, Vietnam seemed like
Just another foreign war
But it wasn't, it was
Different in many ways

As so were those
Who did the fighting
In World War II
The average age of the
Combat soldier was twenty-six
[Chorus]
In Vietnam, he was nineteen
In Vietnam, he was nineteen
In Vietnam, he was nineteen
In Vietnam, he was nineteen
N-n-n-n-nineteen

The heaviest fighting
Of the past two weeks
Continued today twenty-five
Miles northwest of Saigon

I really wasn't sure
What was going on

[Chorus]
N-n-n-n-nineteen, nineteen
N-nineteen, nineteen

In Vietnam, the combat soldier
Typically served a twelve month tour of duty
But was exposed to hostile fire almost everyday

[Chorus]
N-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-nineteen
In Saigon, a US miltary spokesman
Said today, more than 720 troops
Were killed last week in
That sensitive border area
In all of South Vietnam
The enemy lost a total of
2,689 soldiers

[Bridge]
All those who remember the war
They won't forget what they've seen
Destruction of men in their prime
Whose average age was nineteen

D-d-d-d-d-destruction
D-d-d-d-d-destruction

According to a Veteran's Administration study
Half of the Vietnam combat veterans suffered
From what psychiatrists call
Post traumatic stress disorder
Many vets complain of alienation, rage, or guilt
Some succumb to suicidal thoughts
Eight to ten years after coming home
Almost eight-hundred-thousand men
Are still fighting the Vietnam War
None of them received
A hero's welcome

And people criticize me but I know it's not the end

Gets her work done as she waits for the night

And the feeling that she never will tame

Last night, I dug your picture out from my old dresser drawer
I set it on the table and I talked to it 'til four
I read some old love letters right up 'til the break of dawn

I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home

To keep a clear head on my lonely way
The fire crackles in the open air
With my burning memories of a past despair
The more I walk, the less I care
All these things were never really there
I see trees, they are flashing by
I leave it all behind for a better try

Even if my feet are bleeding
I won’t stop, I’ll carry on

No place where I belong
Nothing lasts forever

Did you ask why I keep moving on?

Stop licking your wounds like a dirty hound
Scream it out,  keep your eyes awake
Use your rough and dirty hands to fix all of your mistakes
I wake up, I drop my rattling chains
I wake up, the story never changed
Don’t give me shelter, I wanna feel alive
With all the pain and the hundreds of lies

He's steppin' out and she walks right through the President's door
In this world you know, you're just a fool to take
He'll give you something adds up to nothing
It's your heart that breaks
One heart stands alone
Stripped right down to the bone
One heart easy to break
(How much more can you take?)
(Tell me now that this is just a mistake)
He sits up there like a king, oh, in the company chair
He'll cast you right but you know, it's just so unfair
So you're one more number now in his telephone book
It shows nothing
You've got something from the pleasure he took
One heart stands alone
Stripped right down to the bone
One heart easy to break
(How much more can you take?)
(Tell me now that this is just a mistake)
One heart stands alone
Stripped right down to the bone
One heart easy to break
(How much more can you take?)
(Tell me now that this is just a mistake)
So you think, you're found it
Your one big break got what it takes
And you're tough enough to spot all those fakes
Your first mistake
But you've got something that survives
A burnin' heart stays alive
And now I wish you could do with me
Oh baby, you just couldn't see
He'll give you your something
Adds up to nothing and your heart breaks
One heart stands alone
Stripped right down to the bone
One heart easy to break

One heart stands alone
Stripped right down to the bone

She would not let Green Bay Wisconsin destroy her
Gave her two-week notice to her longtime employer
At Schreiber Foods Incorporated, where she nearly suffocated
She drew a Walt Jabsco with a Sharpie fine point marker
On the back of her army green Fred Perry parka
Drove her Vespa motor scooter overnight right to the valley
To the Lake Geneva motor scooter rally
Checked into the Chateau Royal Inn
She had to let the living part of life begin

Moving on forward, she rallied and she ran
Romp the Moonstomp, she did the running man
Skankin' and a rankin' full stop and full force
One step with the old ""come on""
With no apologies, regrets, shame or remorse

She met the guy that plays the bass for the Pietasters
She had little to no interest, but he chased her
Scalawags Scally cap and Sherman suit

She drank a pint of Guinness Stout and got away
Got out her matte black dear ol' ""Beats by Dre""

I saw him again...yesterday
I wonder if I'll ever see him again
He reminded me of Blue Denim

Blue-gray eyes...they change with the color...
Change with the sun...they run with the sight
They change with the wind...but they're always bright
Bright eyes...Blue Denim
Bright eyes...Blue Denim
I knew him another way
I knew him another day
In some ways he'd forgotten me
In many ways he got to me
I turned away so he couldn't see
I turned away...it could never be
I never thought he could walk away
But I lost him again...yesterday

Is not an easy thing to do
Understanding me...and understanding you

Promise to nauseate

But none of us would chance her
Because she was a samurai
She made electric shadows
Beyond our fingertips
And none of us could reach that high
She came on like a teaser
I had to touch and please her
Enjoy a little paradise
The log was in my pocket
When Lucy met the rocket
She never knew the reason why

Oh, it's not the kill

Sweet Nancy was so fancy
To get into her pants
We had to be the aristocracy
The members that she toyed with
At her city club
Were something in diplomacy
So we put her on the hit list
Of a common cunning linguist
A master of many tongues
Now she eases gently
From her Austin to her Bentley
Suddenly she feels so young
I can't deny it

phish,buried alive,1995,"Tribal Vodoun LyricsFrom deep inside the islands comes
A religious belief of magical fate
Necronomic tribes of the secret societies

Conducting ceremonies of the Vodoun faith
Revenge in store for enemies they hate
Soon to die awaiting to arise

Doomed to die by a malevolent curse
Carnival of chaos
Symbolic designs
Carved in the earth to beckon LEGBA
Rites of the Petro

Reflections of rage and violence
Thundering drums echo unforgiving

Tribal chants grow louder
Dancers travel throughout the fire

Deity of fire OGU
Protects skin from the flames

Divine horsemen arrive
Mounting the initiation of possession

Tearing glass utter pandemonium
Spirits indulge in burning torches

Spinnig dancers wake to reality

Vodoun - cannot be abstracted from the day to day life - of the Believer
All is whole - no separation between material and spiritual

The Bokor concocts the powder with the poisonous Datura
Sprinkled upon the way of his victim
Body racked with terrible convulsions -
Mucus flowered from the nose and mouth shaking horrible
The edge of consciousness
Criteria of poison
Lethargic coma
Indistinguishable from death

Comatose
Mentally alive / pronounced phisically dead
Nails driven into the coffin buried prematurely
Mind slips / disoriented / complete amnesia
Three days fermented incarnation of Evil

Baron SAMEDI
Guardian of the cemetery
Preparing the victim's soul
For Zombification

The fear initiates the victim
Psychologically vulnerable
Powder does not secure

Blood spilt offering
Resurrection of zombie

Aimlessly wandering through time

Didn’t recognise I’d become
No more than alive; I’d barely survive
In a word, overrun

[Chorus 1: Richard Wright]
Won’t hear a sound (He’s curled into the corner)
From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering)
I’ve spent too long (With an endless stream of garbage to)
On the inside out (…curse the place)
My skin is cold (In a sea of random images)
To the human touch (The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart’s (Waiting for the waves to break)
Not beating much
[Verse 2: Richard Wright]
I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don’t even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light, I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile

My nervous system all awry
I’m wearing the inside out

But he’s coming around

It’s been so long since he spoke
Well he can have the words right from my mouth

And with these words I can see
Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name
Now we can hear ourselves again

I’m holding out (He’s standing on the threshold)
For the day (Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he’ll)
Have blown away (…curse the place)
I’m with you now (He’s torn in all directions)
Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering)
Now we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break)

Silhouettes stand against the sky
One in front with a cross held high
Come to wash my sins away

Standing alone in the wind and rain
Feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
Brought by the storm that is brewing
[Verse 2]
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await what is coming

[Verse 3]
Why then is God still protecting me
Even when I don't deserve it?
Though I am blessed with an inner strength
Some, they would call it a penance

[Verse 4]
Why am I meant to face this alone?
Asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive
Inside my head, feel the fear start to rise

They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes
There'll be penance to pay when it's Judgment Day
And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes
They'll be coming to claim, take your soul away

When those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
Maybe it's a part of me you took
To a place I hoped it would never go
And maybe that fucked me up
Much more than you'll ever know

And then throw it all away
Oh I'll throw it all away

Like throwing arms round yesterday

Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do

He came to me asking help and advice
And from here no one knows where he goes
So I sent him to ask of the Owl if he's there
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear

Help me if you can
I've got to get back to the house at Pooh Corner by one
You'd be surprised
There's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky (Chase the clouds away)
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh

It's hard to explain how a few precious things
Seem to follow throughout all our lives
After all's said and done I was watching my son
Sleeping there with my bear by his side
So I tucked him in, I kissed him, and as I was going
I swear that old bear whispered, ""Boy, welcome home""

Believe me if you can
I've finally come
Back to the house at Pooh Corner by one
What do you know? There's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky (Chase the clouds away)
Back to the days of Christopher Robin (Back to the days)
Back to the ways of Christopher Robin (Back to the ways)
Back to the days of PoohEmbed",0.026,0.896,0.078,0.973

Writer Jerry Reed

Well now, listen people let me tell you some news
I'll sing a song called the crude oil blues
We're low on heat .n all
We're low on gas
And I'm so cold I'm about to freeze myâ€¦..self
We got the crude oil blues
Â€˜Cause the winter time sure gets cold to the bottom of my shoes
Well my hands are shakin' and my knees are weak
But it ain't because of love
It's from lack of heat
I'm gonna tell you a story anout this drunk I know
He kept his basement full of homemade brew
But the winter got so bad it screwed up the boy's thinkin'
He got so cold he had to burn all his drinkin'
He's got the crude oil blues
He said the wintertime can sure get cold to the bottom of your shoes
He said, burnin' this booze just destroys my soul
But there's one thing about it honey
When you're cold, you're cold
I've got the crude oil blues
Well, when we made this record there was a little bit of doubt
Whether or not the ting was ever gonna come out
I said, â€œhey chief, you reckon this record will be released?â€
He said, â€œSon, we ain't got enough oil to keep the pressed greasedâ€
We got the crude oil blues
And son, if we can't make records then we don't need you
I said, â€œwhat am I gonna do if I can't sing and pick?â€
He said, â€œwell just keep yourself warm playin' all them hot licks
We got the crude oil blues
Oh mama , don't forget to bring in the brass monkey
And remember what Albert Weinstein saidâ€¦that coolin' is condusive to cuddlinâ€¦
Honey I love ya but pass the duck downâ€¦hey I read a sign on the pump at my
Favorite gas station the other dayâ€¦

There's a glass of punch below your feet and an angel at your head
There's devils on each side of you with bottles in their hands
You need one more drop of poison and you'll dream of foreign lands

When you pissed yourself in Frankfurt and got syph down in Cologne
And you heard the rattling death trains as you lay there all alone
Frank Ryan bought you whiskey in a brothel in Madrid
And you decked some fucking blackshirt who was cursing all the Yids
At the sick bed of Cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayer
But the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chair
And in the Euston Tavern you screamed it was your shout
But they wouldn't give you service so you kicked the windows out
They took you out into the street and kicked you in the brains
So you walked back in through a bolted door and did it all again
At the sick bed of Cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayer
And the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chair

You remember that foul evening when you heard the banshees howl
There was lousy drunken bastards singing ""Billy In The Bowl""
They took you up to midnight mass and left you in the lurch
So you dropped a button in the plate and spewed up in the church

Now you'll sing a song of liberty for blacks and paks and jocks
And they'll take you from this dump you're in and stick you in a box
Then they'll take you to Cloughprior and shove you in the ground
But you'll stick your head back out and shout ""We'll have another round""
At the graveside of Cuchulainn we'll kneel around and pray

[Verse 1]
Lost in the sky
Clouds roll by and I roll with them
Arrows fly
Seas increase and then fall again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This world is spinning around me
This world is spinning without me and
Every day sends future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last
[Verse 2]
Watch the sparrow falling
Gives new meaning to it all
If not today nor yet tomorrow
Then some other day
I'll take seven lives for one
And then my only father's son
As sure as I did ever love him
I am not afraid

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This world is spinning around me
The whole world keeps spinning around me
And all life is future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last

[Chorus 1]
Pull me under, pull me under
Pull me under, I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is to set it right

[Verse 3]
Dust fills my eyes
Clouds roll by and I roll with them
Centuries cry
Orders fly and I fall again

This world is spinning inside me
The whole world is spinning inside of me
Every day sends future to past
Every step brings me closer to my last

Living my life too much in the sun
Only until your will is done

steve earle,ben mcculloch,1995,"Ben McCulloch LyricsWe signed up in San Antone, my brother Paul and me
To fight with Ben McCulloch and the Texas infantry
Well the poster said we'd get a uniform and seven bucks a week
The best rations in the Army and a rifle we could keep

When I first laid eyes on the General, I knew he was a fighting man
He was every inch a soldier, every word was his command
His eyes were cold as the lead and steel forged into tools of war
He took the lives of many and the souls of many more

Well they marched us to Missouri and we hardly stopped for rest
Then he made this speech and said, ""We're coming to the test""
Well we've got to take Saint Louis, boys, before the Yankees do
If we control the Mississippi, then the Federals are through
Well they told us that our enemy would all be dressed in blue
They forgot about the winter's cold and the cursed fever too
My brother died at Wilson's Creek and, Lord, I seen him fall
We fell back to the Boston Mountains in the North of Arkansas

Goddamn you, Ben McCulloch
I hate you more than any other man alive
And when you die
You'll be a foot soldier just like me in the Devil's infantry

And on the way to Fayetteville, we cursed McCulloch's name
And mourned the dead that we'd left behind and we was carrying the lame
I killed a boy the other night who'd never even shaved
I don't even know what I'm fighting for, I ain't never owned a slave

So I snuck out of camp
And then I heard the news next night
The Yankees won the battle
And McCulloch lost his life, yeah

Goddamn you, Ben McCulloch

The minister was preaching
And the crowd was standing near
The congregation sang in a tune
In the hall, it was loud and clear

All of the crowd that stood all around him
They were crying as I could plainly see
Oh, the songs that they sang was so touching
They were singing to my God to Thee
Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

Kept on singing
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

Sometimes, I like to be in company
But when I get out, I like to stay out for long
Song is the only thing that can control me, Lord
When I know trouble, trouble's about to come

I fall down on my knees and call God late at night
And I know He'll make my, my burdens alright
I tell him, Lord, I have a desire to be

I used to wonder what my mother was doing, have mercy, Lord
I stepped out one morning found mother all folded up

And mother had to rise up, she was looking towards the sky
And I saw the tears as they fell down my mothers eyes
And I can still hear the song mother was singing

I suppose they could be true
All about love and what it can do to you
Highest risk of striking out
The risk of getting hurt
And still, I have so much to learn

I know, 'cause I think about it all the time
I know, that real love has quite a price

And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine
My expectations may be high
I blamed it on my youth
Soon enough, I'll learned the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter
Then boast of how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone

I know, 'cause I learn a little every day
I know, 'cause I listen when the experts say

That a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

As I look back on all my childhood dreams
My ideas of love weren't
As foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now
I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days, it's hard to find

I know, it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know, it will all be worth it in the end

And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)

So please be gentle with this heart of mine

Men walking along the railroad tracks
Going someplace, there's no going back
Highway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge
Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge

[Verse 2]
Shelter line stretching around the corner
Welcome to the new world order
Families sleeping in the cars in the southwest
No home, no job, no peace, no rest

Well, the highway is alive tonight
But nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searching for the ghost of Tom Joad

[Verse 3]
He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag
Preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag
Waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box beneath the underpass

[Verse 4]
You got a one-way ticket to the promised land
You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Bathing in the city's aqueduct

[Chorus]
Well the highway is alive tonight
Where it's headed, everybody knows
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Waiting on the ghost of Tom Joad

[Verse 5]
Now Tom said, ""Mom, wherever there's a cop beating a guy
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me, Mom, I'll be there

Wherever somebody's fighting for a place to stand
Or a decent job or a helping hand
Wherever somebody's struggling to be free
Look in their eyes, Ma, and you'll see me""

I don't know how much longer
You're going to be here
So I say my prayers
Every night
One for my mother
One for my father
And one for the love of my life
So if you decide to leave today
Then leave tomorrow at the door
And take only
Half of yesterday
And forget all hope for the present
Cause it just went away

And three wishes

Another night now dawn
Waiting patiently hope that you'll return
But not before long
Why'd you say goodbye
I still feel your presence
In my bed at night
And what was reality once
A love true in form
Has now added pain
For a man scorn
Forced to wear the memories of pain
Around an empty heart

Now I sit in silence and begin to think
As laughter echoes through the air
I can't get you off my mind
But a whole new love
I could never bare
So now I lay
Me down to sleep
And I pray my Lord my soul to keep
And if I die, before I wake
Then I promise I'll be there for you always

And a darn good dancer
When they'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime

And his mama cried as he played in the bars

And sporting Miss Rita back by his side

That some day him and Justice and Nation'd be together again
But Justice held up in a shotgun shack
Wouldn't let nobody in

And can you keep your own Nation warm tonight?

Couldn't keep the boy at home, no no
He just kept running 'round and around and around and around
Independence and Justice well they felt so ashamed
When the Nation fell down they argued who was to blame
And Nation if you'll just come home we'll have this family again
Oh, Nation don't cry

He'll shoot 'em and he'll skin 'em and he'll dress 'em up to eat
But since the spread of mixo He's almost got 'em beat
And I don't mind at all if you call me a Mallee boy
Where little town dogs howl at the morning train
Where a cocky makes a living on twelve inches of rain
Where his woman provides and is rare to complain
And I still love the smell of that sandy soil

Cause it grows the sweetest fat lambs the markets ever sold
And I don't mind at all if you call me a Mallee Boy

Where slickers bring their shotguns from miles away
And shoot the life out of shags and swans that fly their way
Where a bloke grows as stocky as a Mallee bull
Where they come from miles around to see the tractor pull
When the paddocks are clean and seed silos are full

Falling against the lonely tenement
Has set my mind to wander
Into the windows of my lovers
They never know unless I write
""This is no declaration, I just thought I'd let you know, goodbye""

""It is mightier than swords
I could kill you, sure
But I could only make you cry with these words
Cry with these words
Cry with these words

b.b. king,standing on the edge of love,1986,"Standing on the Edge of Love LyricsLate last night I was dreaming
I was dreaming of your charms
I was standing
On the edge of love, darling
With you in my arms

Well you whispered sweet things
And told me
That you loved me and always be true
And you'd stand
On the edge of love with me
If I'd stand with you
I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to slip and fall
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on your call
You know I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to lose my mind
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on you one more time

Now a young man's mind will wander
Wander to distant shores
If you'll just come here
And stand with me
I won't wander no more

I promise to stop all of my gambling
Even stop staying out late all night
Might even settle down and have babies
Treat ourselves right

'Cause a young man's dreams are many
Lord, so few come true
So if you'll just come here
And stand with me
I'll stand with you
That's why I say you know
I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to slip and fall
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on your call, that's why I say
You know, I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to lose my mind
Standing on the edge of love, darling
Waiting on you one more time

Standing on the edge of love
Waiting on you one more time

new order,1963,1986,"1963 Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was January 1963
When Johnny came home with a gift for me
He said, ""I bought it for you because I love you
And I bought it for you 'cause it's your birthday, too""
He was so very nice, he was so very kind
To think of me at this point in time
I used to think of him, he used think of me

[Pre-Chorus]
He told me to close my eyes
My gift would be a great surprise
I saw tears were in his eyes
He never meant to hurt me

Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
There's so many ways our lives have changed
But please, I beg, don't do this to me
Johnny, don't point that gun at me
Can I save my life at any price?
For God's sake won't you listen to me?

[Verse 2]
And though he was ashamed that he had took a life
Johnny came home with another wife
And he often remembered how it used to be
Before that special occasion, 1963
There's too many ways that you could kill someone
Like in a love affair, when the love has gone
He used to think of her, she used to think of him

[Pre-Chorus]
He told me to close my eyes
My gift would be a great surprise
I saw hatred in his eyes
But he never meant to hurt me

Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
There's so many ways our lives have changed
But please, I beg, don't do this to me

No farewell souvenirs
Not even a token, when the spell is broken

You never gave me back the love I gave to you

Someday you'll find out that you can't escape my love

I'll come back as another woman
One with all the secrets to your heart
I'll come back as another woman
I'll be the one you burn for
That you reach for in the dark
I'll be the one that breaks your devil heart
Some day you'll wake up with your arms around a dream
The love that she will make to you will be too good to believe
You'll say: ""I love you,"" and for once it will be true
You'll fall too fast to realise who you're talking to

You'll give your heart and soul, she'll be the only one
You'll be hers completely, there'll be no way you can run
And with a smile she'll break your loving heart in two

The knives fly out like bullets upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless, impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory and the seeds of death he's sown

GO!

(???) was just a video game
Cynthia says hi to me
Make a wish on a machine at a shitty carnival
It means something to me
I wake the next morning with an unpleasant surprise
Well Billy knows it's me and borrows some cash and takes me to NYC
Get a job about toys and computers you know that's my specialty
What am I gonna do I'm thirteen yeah and thirty
They said it would take just six weeks to fix my damn problem
I could get lucky and find that, find that damn Zoltar

Now I'm with someone and work my way up 'cause she means the world to me
Talk to the boss man and get in good with the head of the company
Billy (???) Sea Point Park and it means nothing to me
Now I confess to Susan and talk to her and tell her that I'm thirteen
(???) says I can't handle you, you mean nothing to me
What am I gonna do? I'm locked, I want to go home

They said it would take just six weeks to fix my damn problem
I could get lucky and find that, find that damn Zoltar

phish,punch you in the eye,1996,"Punch You in the Eye LyricsI come from the land where the oceans freeze
Spent three long months on the open seas
Paddled 'til it seemed I could take no more
When my ship hit ground on Prussia's shores

How was I to know that day
That the winds had swept me Wilson's way
Cause soon towards me from the East
Came Wilson and his men on multi-beasts

Well it seems he didn't like my face
And I quickly learned that Prussia was an evil place
They tied me to a chair with a giant clip
And held a piece of paper to my tender nip(ple)
Then they tossed the chair in a tiny shack
And told me not to worry cause they'd soon be back
But I loosened up the binds where my hands were lashed
And ran towards the cove where my boat was stashed

Singing ""Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, Punch you in the Eye""

When Wilson knew that I was loose
I'd surely be subjected to some real abuse
Maybe end up hanging from the nearest tree
So angrily I paddled to the open sea

But the sea was eager to beat me back
And the waves grew huge and deadly black
And the gray clouds rumbled over my head
And I feared in my heart that I'd soon be dead

When the morning came and the storm had passed
And the dismal fog began at last
To open up before my eyes
And there I saw to my surprise

Chains and specks of islands curved
Where palm trees dipped and seagulls swerved
And I parked my kayak on a stone
And yelled across the ocean to his evil throne
I said ""Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, Punch you in the Eye
Wilson, kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, Punch you in the Eye""Embed",0.194,0.748,0.058,-0.9965

Without sadness and sorrows in my life

We need to find some love
So much disillusion

There is so much going down
To keep my feet on solid ground
Got to find an answer to my payers

In my life, on yeah
Come along now, now, now, now
Come along now, now, now, now

And watch the river flow into the sea
You travel down a highway, not knowing where it goes
And listening to the music as it flows

Counting the clouds up in the sky
Getting all those complications
And those mad situations out of my life

Everybody thought she'd go far
And at twenty years old she was rich as could be
And a world-famed Hollywood star
With the big parts comin' and the sweethearts, too
Life was a hell of a ride

She was sittin' in her kitchenette
Listenin' to the scuttle of the rats in the wall
And starin' at her TV set
She once might have been too proud to be found
In a hovel on the lower East Side
But nothin' in the world seemed to matter much now
So she took a lot of pills and died

Nothin' in the world seemed to matter to her

And she never may be again
But every once in a while at the far end of the dial
You can see her like she was back then
In a soft close-up, with her hair backlit
She seemed to glow inside
But somethin' went wrong 'cause forty years on

But I hope they know'd my life stood for things that were important
And I'll hand out the same sturdy old values of my daddy and my momma

So the story, it is told
Old John Sutter went to the mill site
Found a piece of shining gold

Well, he took it to the city
Where the word, like wildfire, spread
And old John Sutter soon came to wish he'd
Left that stone in the river bed

For they came like herds of locusts
Every woman, child and man
In their lumbering Conestogas
They left their tracks upon the land
Some would fail and some would prosper
Some would die and some would kill
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill

Well, they came from New York City
And they came from Alabam'
With their dreams of finding fortunes
In this wild unsettled land

Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows
As they tried to cross the plains
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains
With their hands froze to the reins
Oh...

Some would fail and some would prosper
Some would die and some would kill
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill

Well, some pushed on to California
And others stopped to take their rest
And by the Spring of Eighteen-sixty
They had opened up the west
And then the railroad came behind them
And the land was plowed and tamed
When Old John Sutter went to meet his maker
He'd not one penny to his name
Oh...

Some would die and some would kill
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance

Is there a chance you'll be showing me

One time for old times, (darlin') one kiss for the love we missed
One time for old times, and for all the love that we've lost along the way
You're still the same, nothing's really changed
Still got the look that always got through to me
I see you now, love feels new to me again, once again
Tell me now, has anyone taken my place
Is there any chance you'll come back to me
One time for old times, honey, one kiss for the love we missed

And the children are hopin' for a heart-attack

And the lamppost can't stop cryin'

I've waited for you all those years
Then just when it began he took your love away

cory morrow,the man that i've been,1993,"The Man That I’ve Been LyricsI spent my last two birthdays in the Travis County jail
Tomorrow I go up with life but I should go straight to hell
But hell's got no more room for me and it's got no more time
I should be confessin' all my crimes
Four years ago my debt was piled high up on my mind
And I devised a plan to rob a bank just to survive
When the gun smoke cleared I saw two bodies on the ground
13 hours later I was found

No don't you feel any sorrow for the man that I've been
'Cause in the waking of tomorrow, they will find me full of sin
Well I got news for you, I ain't as bad as they say
I got news for you, looks like that just don't matter today
Oh well the verdict came in right away, guilty indeed
99 to life is what I heard the jury
They thought that might impress upon me crime does not pay
But I ain't one for listenin' today
And as the years go by and by upon the shadowed grounds I walk
The people and the places of my past have now been lost
That man that I've been is not the man I hoped to be
Now it's too late to find the good in me

To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know
The river is wide
I walk down every evening
And I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find
What I've been looking for

I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't
Want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is
That I've been looking for

In the middle of the night

Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something

That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

God knows I've never
Been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire
I wade into the river

I was fed well
On what had come before

Left a lesson
Regarding what's in store

They were just like you and me
Guessing their asses off

It's our turn now, I hope we're forgiven
Chalk it up to knowledge and change
And life itself

And as I shall learn to follow
I'll feed the leaders
With everything I can
They'll bring revolutions
That try as I may
I just won't understand

They will be just like you and me
Pretending they're not guessing
As if we couldn't tell

It'll be their turn then, I hope we can forgive them
Chalk it up to knowledge and change
And life itself

It seems a cycle that we all seem to share
The passing from hand to hand of our pride and despair
Both parent and child cry apathy but everybody cares
And then we vanish in thin air
And only time is there
Time and a legacy
History holds questions for everyone
A story that's only just begun
Blind passed the goddamn horizon
Sees more than father less than son
Life and death merely pretending
We're part of the infinite ending

We are gonna teach and learn
We're gonna get fed well
And then we shall feed
We, we are ancient
We are brand spanking new
We shall follow and lead

‘Cause we are simply you and me
In proving our traditions
On the brink of heaven and hell

Don't care if it is true 'cause I love it so well

The people fed him well 'cause he treated them so right
Oh oh oh oh Jolly Mon sing
Oh oh oh oh make Orion ring

And they wanted him to sing on the island near and far
He always found his way by Orion lucky star
He'd tell them of their joys, he'd tell them of their woes
They loved to see him come, they'd hate to see him go

He was makin' his way home on a dark and stormy night
When he heard a cry for help, he saw a flashin' light
When he reached the other boat and offered them a hand
They said, ""Give us all your cargo"" as the took a pirate stand
Oh oh oh oh, Jolly Mon sing
Oh oh oh oh, give 'em everything

""Jolly Mon it's over sing your last song very well""
They tossed him in the ocean 'cause their hearts were made in Hell
Came along a dolphin, he said, ""Jolly Mon hello!
I've always loved your singing, climb aboard, don't let go.""

Oh oh oh oh, make the oceans ring

The night was filled with magic, they bid the sea goodbye
They swam into the heavens, they stayed up in the sky
And all the Island people when they wish upon a star
See the Dolphin and the Jolly Mon who tell them where they are

Invented a contraption that we know so well
By the 1950's they were in everybody's home
As a crazy little thing they call the telephone
Now there's one on every corner, in the back of every bar
You can get one in your briefcase, on a plane or in your car

So tell me why, haven't I heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I say now, ""Darling, honey, what is your excuse?
Why haven't I heard from you?""

Well there's no problem getting to me
Baby you can dial direct
I got call forwarding and call waiting
You can even call collect
The service man he told me that my phone is working fine
And I've come to the conclusion trouble isn't with my line
I'm sure the operator will be glad to put you through
So dial zero for assistance if this all confuses you

Tell me why, haven't I heard from you

A fire that burns up the wires
And a thunder so loud with a black funnel cloud
A natural disaster I know nothing about

So many mornings now, I shouldn't be surprised
When you lash out at me then you scream out in the night
What could you have done to get in such an awful fright?

Is it all that bad that you think I shouldn't see?
Well who're you gonna talk to if you can't tell me?

Where'd you hide the body?
Where'd you stash the loot?
Just keep your hands where I can see them
So I don't have to shoot
There's a smoking pistol at your side
That you swear it's not the one
Where'd you hide the body?
Where'd you get the gun?
Where'd you hide the body?
Where'd you get the gun?

When cornered you complain about the state of your career
And you look intently straight ahead, pretending I'm not here
And you look me in the eye and say ""It's not about us""
And you tell me I'm so silly to be making such a fuss

So everything's okay except you're nervous as a cat
But what's it say about me if you think I'd fall for that?
Come on

Where'd you hide the body?
Where'd you stash the loot?
Just keep your hands where I can see them
And maybe I won't shoot

There's a smoking pistol at your side
And you swear it's not the one
Where'd you hide the body?
Where'd you get the gun?
Where'd you hide the body?
Where'd you ditch the gun?
Just keep your hands where I can see them
Make no attempt to run

You used to always throw me off your trail
But I guess those days are through
Where'd you hide the body?

The future is no place
To place your better days

From a crowd 10,000 wide
Hope laid upon hope
That this crowd will not subside
Let this flag burn to dust
And a new a fair design be raised
While we wait head in hands
Hands in prayer
And fall into a dreamless sleep again
And we wave our hands

But gold between divide us
Hands and feet are all alike
But fear between divide us

A mirror in which

Something he had never had but hoped would come along

Where we are all confined
While we wave hands in fire
Wave our hands

In this room stood a little child
And in this room this little child
She would remain
Until someone might decide
To dance this little child
Across this hall
Into a cold, dark, space
Where she might never trace her way across this crooked mile
Across this crooked page
Cry freedom, cry
From deep inside where
We are all confined
Till we wave our hands

We're all a bunch of brothers living in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called LA

LA is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton-picking maze
The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps, but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Alike dump on a thumb, pop hump, hump, hump, pop out
The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
Because I'm shooting for the top, and my best friend's a Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls could pop
But he never met the tree, so he never bebopped, hop out

Antoine the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
Wore a cold paisley jacket and a hella fine ass
In between his legs was a sweet young lass
Threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd love them all
By the time he got to ninety-nine, he had to stop
'Cause that's when he thought that he heard a fop

[Bridge]
Last night and the night before
I heard a fop outside, then I
Came indoors! Rock out!

Now that I told ya somethin' about the Flea
Somethin' 'bout the Tree, a little somethin' 'bout me
I can't leave you hanging 'bout my man Sherm Zee
He swings the ying, he bangs the yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his thang
You better be burnin' Sherman!

The family would gather out at grandpa's house
With supper over and the dishes done
It was then the best time came
At an old upright piano that only grandma played

She played beautiful dreamer, my wild Irish rose;
She never played 'em perfect, but there was love in every note
Grandpa sat beside her, in harmony they sang
At the old upright piano that only grandma played
Grandpa was a stubborn man, they said it was his style
Grandma called him ornery, but she said it with a smile
Even he could not disguise the love he felt so strong;
We all could see it in his eyes when she played his favorite song

She played beautiful dreamer, my wild Irish rose;
She never played 'em perfect, but there was love in every note
Grandpa sat beside her, in harmony they sang
At the old upright piano that only grandma played

I was almost 17 when my grandma died;
I stayed all night with grandpa; the old man never cried
He sat at her piano, there was nothing we could say
It was the first time in my life I ever heard my grandpa play

It wasn't beautiful dreamer or my wild Irish rose
It was a song he played from memory & he never missed a note
I sat right there beside him until the morning came
What a friend we have in Jesus was the only song he played

She played beautiful dreamer, my wild Irish rose;
She never played 'em perfect, but there was love in every note

And coasting a terrace, approaching a rift
Through which I could spy several glimpses beneath
Of the darkness the light from above could not reach
I spied wings of reason, herself taking flight
And upon yonder precipice saw her alight
And glared back at me one last look of dismay
As if she were the last one she thought I'd betray

So much the better I said to myself
And drawing quite close to the top of the shelf
I struggled with destiny upon the ledge
And gasped when defeated he slipped off the edge
And silence contagious in moments like these
Consumed me and strengthened my will to appease
The passion that sparked me one terrible night
And shocked and persuaded my soul to ignite

While babies with open mouth holler and shout
Shed tears for food, to eat day and night

So mixed South-Africa no, they are lying
You can't get nothing to eat
They all are freaks
Come and get shot
Some send to the desert to suffer

Why stomp and steer when technology is advance?
Your reward shall be your treat

Alright

[Verse 1: Tim Armstrong]
Hey little sister, do you know what time it was
When you finally seen all your broken dreams
Come crashin' down your door?
I said, they demand an answer, and they demand it quick
Or the questions fade and then the wasted days
Come crawlin' back for more
And I said

(Do you know where the power lies?)
And who pulls the strings?
(Do you know where the power lies?)
I said it starts and ends with you

[Verse 2: Tim Armstrong]
The face of isolation
Well, that's one you recognize
When you can't get straight
It's a lonely place
And it's one you do despise
I said, boredom is for sale now
And the helplessness you feel
Is a wounded dove and the hawks are above
Blood splattered on a reel to reel
And I said

[Chorus]
(Do you know where the power lies?)
And who pulls the strings?
(Do you know where the power lies?)
I said it starts and ends with you

[Interlude]
[Verse 3: Tim Armstrong]
Yeah, I was almost over
And my world was almost gone
In a sudden rush I could almost touch the
Things that I'd done wrong
My jungle's made of concrete
And through the silence I could feel
That my aim is true and I will walk on through
These mountains made of steel
And I said

[Chorus]
(Do you know where the power lies?)
And who pulls the strings?
(Do you know where the power lies?)

""Are they worms or are they serpents?"" bubbles through the ice
The source was quite invisible, the ever-present voice
While skating, both legs tracing different shapes, I made my choice
I’m mimicking the image in whose radiance I bask
I’m tied to him, or him to me, depending who you ask
None the less reluctantly reflections tumble in
I slide with all the other on the wrong side of the skin

He’s fallen on the ice, it cracks
Will he plunge in and join me here?
He meets my eyes, to my surprise
He laughs in full light of my frown
My double wants to pull me down
[Verse 2]
Slipping on the friction slide, my skin peels to the bone
The flesh I leave behind, is something that is not my own
I beg my mirror image for a moment with my soul
He’s leaning back, time to attack, it’s me who’s in control
And every move I make he’s got a hand up just in time
He’s throwing several punches, and he’s blocking most of mine
Defeated now I sulk and squirm above the frozen heights
Waiting, calculating 'til he ventures onto the ice

I've known about you for a while now
When he leaves me he wears a smile now
As soon as he's away from me
In your arms is where he wants to be
But you're the one he rushes home to
You're the one he gave his name to
I never see his face in the early morning light
You have his mornings, his daytimes
And sometimes I have his nights
[Pre-Chorus]
But does he love you? (does he love you?)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you? (does he think of you?)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies?
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?

[Chorus 1]
But when he's with me, he says he needs me
And that he wants me, that he believes in me

[Chorus 2]
And when I'm in his arms, oh he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me, or am I deceiving myself?

[Bridge]
Oh, shouldn’t I lose my temper?
Oh, and shouldn’t I be ashamed?
Cause I have everything to lose
And I, I have nothing to gain

Like he loves me (like he loves me)

Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?

The cherry blossom in the market square?

And, Kayleigh, could we get it together again?
I just can't go on pretending that it came to a natural end

And, Kayleigh, I thought that we'd always be friends
We said our love would last forever
So how did it come to this bitter end?
Oh yeah

I've seen sorrow
Heartache and pain
I've been burned by the sunshine
Been drowned in the pouring rain
Had too many lovers
And not enough love
I've been tried and convicted
For things I'm not guilty of
I was locked in a prison
Till you came and set me free
So how can you say
You're no good for me
Now that the magic has gone
You just wanna walk away
Nothing left to say, anyway
Now that the magic has gone
There's no sense in holding on
Baby now, now that the magic is gone

You know love can be tender
Love can be cruel
It can smile like an angel
While it treats you just like a fool
It captures and haunts you
Until you give in
And it stacks the dice against you
In a game you never can win
Just when I was thinking
Maybe luck was here with me
You tell me it's over
Say it's time for breaking free

Now that the magic has gone
You just wanna walk away
Nothing left to say, anyway
Now that the magic has gone
There's no sense in holding on
Baby now, now that the magic is gone
I won't try to hold you down
My mind tells me let go
But my heart keeps asking how
There's no prizes for the loser
Only the winner takes the purse
Some say that love is a blessing
But to me it's just a curse

And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show

And suffer with my ghost

cracker,big dipper,1996,"Big Dipper LyricsCigarettes and carrot juice
Get yourself a new tattoo
For those sleeveless days of June
I'm sitting on the Cafe Zinho steps
With a book I haven't started yet
Watching all the girls walk by

Could I take you out
I'd be yours without a doubt
On that big dipper
And if the sound of this it frightens you
We could play it real cool
And act somewhat indifferent
And hey June
Why'd you have to come
Why'd you have to come around so soon
I wasn't ready for all this nature
The terrible green, green grass
The violent blooms of flower dresses
And afternoons that make me sleepy

But we could wait awhile
Before we push that dull turnstile
Into the passage
The thousands they have tread
And others sometimes fled
Before the turn came

And we could wait our lives
Before a chance arrives
Before the passage
From the top you can see Monterey
Or think about San Jose
Although I know it's not that pleasant

And hey Jim Kerouac
Brother of the famous Jack
Or so he likes to say, lucky bastard
He's sitting on the cafe's inner steps
With a girl that I'm not over yet
Watching all the world go by
Boy you're looking bad
Did I make you feel that sad?
I'm honestly flattered
But if she asks me out
I'd be hers without a doubt
On that big dipper

A cigarette and carrot juice
And get yourself a new tattoo
For those sleeveless days of June
I'm sitting on the Cafe Zinho steps
I haven't got the courage yet
I haven't got the courage yet

Now that smokey conversation's come and gone
Do I just read between your lines?
Or could it be this winter wine?... so sweet upon my tongue tonight
Recalls your tender eyes

O, I need more than a whisper... so much more than a whisper
It takes more than a whisper to wake this weary fool
Give me more than a whisper... if you're sayin' I love you
'cuz it's the whispers I have never understood
It's snowin' up in the northlands... I read your warm words from the plains
While the poets say that I should never be thinkin' of you this way
They say that I misread your lines 'cuz I've been lonely all my life
And here I'm reachin' for some silver and leavin' my heart out in the fire

O, I need more than a whisper... so much more than a whisper
It takes more than a whisper to wake this weary fool
Give me more than a whisper... if you're sayin' I love you
'cuz it's the whispers I have never understood

I will drink my winter wine... when I get home I'll change my mind
I'll only whisper that I love you in those smokey bars at night
And though the poets say I'm lonely... there's still this woman here inside
And I've never been a fool when my heart was on the line

Once prompted you to say

Stretching my love down the way
To your invitation stretching my body
Use your intuitive play
'Cause maybe we have more play time than money

Carry further, entangled strands all sing

And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well, in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees

And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart

Smoking your cigarettes, and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart, and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must've gone off track with you

Think I've mistaken you for somebody else

He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect

[Verse 2]
He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance
[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

He may play the jack of diamonds
He may lay the queen of spades
He may conceal a king in his hand
While a memory of it fades

I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

And if I told you that I loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong

And find out to their cost
Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost

lloyd cole and the commotions,lost weekend,1985,"Lost Weekend LyricsIt took a lost weekend in a hotel in Amsterdam
And double pneumonia in a single room
And the sickest joke was the price of the medicine
Are you laughing at me now?
May I please laugh along with you?

This morning I woke up from a deep, unquiet sleep
With ashtray clothes and this lonely heart's pen
With which I wrote for you a lovesong in tattoo upon my palm
'Twas stolen from me when Jesus took my hand
You see I, I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it
Drop me and I'll fall to pieces
So easily

I was a king bee with a head full of attitude
Wore my heart on my sleeve like a stain
And my aim was taboo, you
Could we meet in the marketplace
Did I ever hey please, did you wound my knees?

You see I, I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it
Drop me and I'll fall to pieces
Yeah, too easy

There's nobody else to blame
I hang my head in a crying shame
There's nobody else to blame
Nobody else 'cept my sweet self, oh, yeah

It took a lost weekend in a hotel in Amsterdam
Twenty-four gone years to conclude in tears
And the sickest joke was the price of the medicine
Are you laughing at me now
May I please laugh along?

I was a king bee with a head full of attitude
An ashtray heart on my sleeve, wounded knees
And my one love song was a tattoo upon my palm
You wrote upon me when you took my hand
You see I, I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it

How could they be so in love and still never see
Now nothing could be sadder than

See no signs of a better time and place
Have we lost the key to an open door

The doctor takes your credit card
In the emptiness of the night, when you never feel satisfied
And you're missin' what could make it right

betty carter,spring can really hang you up the most,1993,"Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most LyricsOnce I was a sentimental thing;
Threw my heart away each spring
Now a spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring this year has got me feeling
Like a horse that never left the post
I lie in my room
Staring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most
Morning's kiss wakes trees and flowers
And to them I'd like to drink a toast
But I walk in the park
Just to kill the lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon the birds twitter-twitt
I know the tune. This is love, this is it
Heard it before
And don't I know the score
And I've decided that spring is a bore

Love seems sure around the new year
Now it's April. Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
Only what became of you, dear?
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way. I thought it would last
We had our day, now it's all in the past
Spring came along, a season of song
Full of sweet promise
But something went wrong

Doctors once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help one bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most
All alone, the party is over
Old man winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the mostEmbed",0.084,0.738,0.178,0.9851

Did he say goodbye to you
Or did you kick him out?

To go alone

When the planets shift?
Whatcha gonna do
Gonna slit your wrist?
And bleed all over the Milky Way

The tears of a dove

The trust of a woman
In his hand
But he was a little boy
Not a man
You loved him stronger
Than he could feel
Yeah he was wrapped up in himself like an orange peel

Now whatcha gonna do
With the booze and the blush?
Whatcha gonna do
When there's no rush?
Cop a little misery
At the corner store
Well one day that train of pain won't stop no more

the grace thrillers,around god's throne,1995,"I Am Annihilation LyricsThe night has closed around me
And hymns perverse and purposeless haunt the ears that guide my steps
For in this lightless valley, my eyes are too deceived
Even nature’s glory, by chaos and cacophony
Is shrouded in the smoke of altars heaped with stillborn carcasses

Are Molech’s nostrils never filled?
Is Hades’ bloodlust never thrilled?
Are creatures made to worship flesh
And sacrifice their souls to Death?
The mind of man slaves to his feeble heart
Deception his sculptor, destruction his art
Devolution named progress by the fallen and depraved
To crown villainy with power and so justice evade

This midwife’s hand outstretched for Gaia’s last travail
As she brings forth her finalborn in blood and wrath and misery
I long to see her afterbirth, her turmoils all fulfilled
But weep amidst the agony – the blood of souls forever spilled

How many thousand times has the almighty stayed your hand
Since the dragon mustered all the darkened stars
To assault the throne of God, to poison the Wellspring of Life
Turn all its grace to curses and quench its very source?

Oh, Angel of Annihilation, thy beauty veiled
Until revilers and deceivers kneel to kiss the edge of your sword

Oh, still your soul and calm your every fear
When morning hides its face, I will be near

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay
[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The taste was sweeter

With friends surrounded

Waiting all week for Saturday night

Play it hot 'cause I came in here to dance

Got my paycheck in my pocket
Darling we'll spend every dime
And when this bar starts rocking
We'll show them all just how to unwind
Don't worry bout your troubles
Leave 'em at the door
And I'll meet you out on the floor

randy travis,the box,1994,"The Box LyricsOn the top shelf in the closet in the workshop where he spent his extra time
Was a dusty wooden box but I had never noticed till that time
Then we set it on the table and carefully we opened up the top
And stared into the memories daddy kept inside the box
There was a letter from mama when
She went out to Reno to help her sister out in sixty two
And a flower from Hawaii when they went on vacation
It was the first time that my daddy ever flew
And the pocket knife I gave to him on fathers day
Years ago I thought it had been lost
We all thought his heart was made of solid rock
But that was long before we found the box
I guess we always knew it, but 'I love you' was hard for him to say
Some men show it easily and some just never seem to find the way
But that night I began to see a softer side of someone I had lost
I saw the love he kept inside the first time when we opened up the box
There was a picture that was taken
When he and mom were dating standin' by his 1944
And the faded leather Bible, he got when he was baptized
I guess no one understood him like the Lord
And the poem that he had written about his wife and children
The tender words he wrote were quite a shock
We all thought his heart was made of solid rock
But that was long before we found the box
We all thought his heart was made of solid rock

Victims of tomorrow
The way it goes, it never shows
Emptiness or sorrow
There is nothing left inside
Nothing left to cry for
So I justify my crimes
Things that I must die for
[Short Instrumental Break]

So alone, away it goes
The life that you have wasted
You never know where it might go
The sweet success you've tasted
Tested by a bitter frown
Knowing I must die for
Can't confide to all the lies
No one to inquire

As I wander, change of seasons
As I realise that I'll soon be there

I'll let you know, the reapers show
Makes you beg or borrow
He comes to see the tragedy
His fate he will not follow
Wearing your electric crown
The preacher starts to pray
Shiver as the lights go down
Heed these words I say

As I wander, change of seasons
I can't ponder, got my reasons
As I realise I don't care
All I know is that I'll soon be there

Now it's done, the time has come
The people stand in silence
Another dawn has come and gone
His fate has been decided
There is no one left inside
A brain without mind
Traces of a bitter man
Are all that you will find

There's no way you can bring it back again

And make a promise not to hurt again this holy ground
What are we doing to this sacred heart, this heart that's beating for us all
'Cause everywhere I see it torn apart as tears like rain will fall
Why don't we take the time, take a look inside
Try to understand what's going wrong
Stop trying to change the tide, overcome our pride
Take off our shoes, this place we're standing on is holy ground
Get out of doing the things you do in the dark
Keep the flame alive in your heart

What are we doing to the children's lives, the ones we shouldn't hurt at all
'Cause in the night I hear their lonely cries, so frail and small
How can we just stand by and watch them fade and die
Before they even reach the age of ten
Why don't we heal the pain, take away this shame
And make a vow to give them back again this holy ground

We proceeded to get down
She turned me on
I dropped the telephone

Moonlight hits the Rio Grande
And the touch of her hand
It makes me high
Like the Fourth of July

The bad bandido came into town
But man, I'm gonna hunt that gringo down
But these words keep ringin' in my ear
A little bit is better than nada
Sometime you want the whole enchilada
A little bit is better than nada
A little bit or nothin' at all

Said Cancun was not her style
Turistas there, they drove her wild
The border's the place
Put on a brand new face

Me and the boys had just hit town
Shake 'em up and rode 'em down
I guess it was fate
I hope I wasn't too late

Bad, bad boys was on our trail
Federales want us all in jail
But these words keep ringin' in my ear

It was a happy day but kinda' sad
And I wish I coulda' been there
Yea I wish I coulda' been there
I wish I coulda' been there for that

Now Bobby and Kate are all grown up
And moved away
They stay in touch
We're proud of the two good kids we raised
And it's hard to believe we are celebrating our twenty fifth year today
This party's nice but the kids aren't here
At least they called to say
Congratulations mom and dad

I wish we could have been there
I wish we could have been there
I wish we could have been there for that
It was a happy day, but kinda' sad
And I wish they could have been there

Crooked landing, crooked landlord
Narrow laneway filled with crooks

Why did they change the locks?
Why did I have to break in, I only came here to talk
This is where we used to live
How is the neighbour downstairs?
How is her temper this year?
I turned up your TV and stomped on the floor just for fun
I know we don't live here anymore
We bought an old house on the Danforth
She loves me and her body keeps me warm
And I'm happy here

Blending into dull tableaux

jellyfish,new mistake,1993,"New Mistake LyricsCurtain opens, spotlights the gentleman
Signing his love letter ""Best wishes, Simpleton""
Dialog swam from his pen like pollywogs
He knew better that perfume was gravity
Pulling him closer to what could be tragedy
Love is blind, deaf and dumb, but never mind

You better catch me when I fall
I'm on my roller skates
Cause any ol' way that I fall
I land in your arms even though it's wrong
Cause I love my new mistake
Intermission gave way to a miracle
The birth of an accident grew to a spectacle
That couldn't wait
The mother was three weeks late
So Father Mason clutching his crucifix
Baptized the baby in whiskey and licorice
What a lovely way
Drowning sins in tooth decay

Looks like our hero's gonna fall
The boughs are bound to break
Cause any ol' way that I fall
I'll be in your arms as we lie awake
With our lovely new mistake

You better catch me when I fall
My sugar trampoline
Cause any ole way that I fall
I land in your arms even though it's wrong
Cause I love my new mistake

The ending turned tragic when many years later
The baby had grown up and married a pop singer
I guess it was her turn to make (her first mistake)

Any ole time at all
Any ole way that I fall
Any ole time at all
Any ole way that I fall

You used to follow; now you lead
College has enlightened you
And you are proud to be different
And like different bands, different types
You ain't nobody's fool

It's like certain bands remind you of someone you hated
Cause they didn't wear the right clothing
And there's only one true fashion
And a lot of the bands on the college charts are great bands
Until they get signed; then you hate them
It's such bullshit
You used to love them, you hypocrite!

But now you're a DJ and preaching that hype
""Corporate rock sucks,"" you know
""College radio enlightens you.""

It's supposed to serve as a means to expose new bands without prejudice
But it makes no sense
""Safe Harbor for the Underground""

And get a pad
Then ""they sold out"" and ""their music's cliche,""
Because talent's exclusive to bands without pay!

Of lightnin', wind, and rain
And the sound of thunder is spookin' the herd
And I fear there'll be a stampede

Their bellows strike fear in my heart
I know if the stom lasts very much longer
There's bound to be a stampede

The lightnin's glare on the restless herd
Makes it seem like a sea's angry swell
Then, all of a sudden, a bolt of fire
Strikes the tree where my pony stands
As I fall to the ground, I can hear the sound
Of a drover yellin' ""Stampede!""

I could hear the herd bearin' down
And I crawled in a ditch where a tree came to rest
And I crouched between it and the ground
It seems like a miracle of God's hand
It's over and I'm still alive
And I thank the ""Trail Boss"" up in the sky
For sparin' me from the stampede

A little girl, a little small for her age
A little too slow for the field day race
Momma's waiting at the finish line
And wipes the teardrops from her eyes
She says, ""You did just fine honey, that's okay
Sometimes life's just that way
You're gonna lose the race from time to time
But you're always gonna find

""You can't lose me

I am here and I will always be
Just a wish away
Wherever you go
No matter how far
My love is where you are
You won't be lost if you believe
You can't lose me""

Momma used to say ""Girl it won't be long
Till it's time to go out on your own
Chase your dreams find your place in life
I know you'll do just fine""
When that day finally came
There were things she needed to but could not say
So I whispered softly as I wiped the tears from momma's eyes

roy clark,yesterday when i was young,1996,"Yesterday, When I Was Young LyricsYesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away

Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all
Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for

I sat there nearly lifeless
An old man in the corner sang
""Where The Water Lilies Grow""
And on the jukebox Johnny sang
About a thing called love
And it's how are you kid and what's your name
And how would you bloody know?
In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky
I lay down on the ground
And the arms and legs of other men
Were scattered all around
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed
Then prayed and bled some more
And the only thing that I could see
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me

And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
For a pair of brown eyes
I looked at him he looked at me
All I could do was hate him
While Ray and Philomena sang
Of my elusive dreams
I saw the streams, the rolling hills
Where his brown eyes were waiting
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
That waited once for me
So drunk to hell I left the place
Sometimes crawling, sometimes walking
A hungry sound came across the breeze
So I gave the walls a talking
And I heard the sounds of long ago
From the old canal
And the birds were whistling in the trees

Soon to let me drown beneath the undertow
Aughta put that woman in a looney bin
Cause you know I'd really like to be a part of her show!

Suzy is an artist - she paints quite a lot
An artist she may be, but a genius she is not
She says she wants to be a sociologist
But she better first get checked by a neurologist

Chorus

Suzy's 'bout as faithful as a slot machine
Pays off once in a while, then she robs you clean
She's always afraid that she's not sure what she's worth
She's out of her mind, and she's not of this Earth

Woman walks the streets like she's queen of the town
Doesn't talk very much, she's very profound!
Little Suzy Greenberg's always playing a game
Since the day we first met, she's probably forgot my name!

A word so wrongfully abused
Are you like me, confused?
All included but you
Alone

Shapes and colors shift with mood
Pupils widen, change their hue
Rapid brown avoid clear blue

Be this way, be this way

A child sings an unclaimed tune
Innocence spins cold cocoon
Grow to see the pain too soon

When your dancing shoes have lost their shine I'm going to be gone in mine

First time I felt the magic of her kiss
Was under a Carolina moon
Sweet Southern style
Tender but a little wild
For me no other love will ever do

Her voice is like the whisper
Of a warm wind through the pines
Her smile can reach the soul of any man
Her heart is strong, her love is true
And her touch is soft as lace
There ain't nothing like a woman with Southern grace
You should see the way she walks into a room
It's almost like her feet don't touch the floor
But when the chips are down
Her feet are firmly on the ground
I could never ask for any more

Her voice is like the whisper
Of a warm wind through the pines
Her smile can reach the soul of any man
Her heart is strong, her love is true
And her touch is soft as lace
There ain't nothing like a woman with Southern grace

She's got me fallin' in her eyes again tonight
Lost in lovin' arms as the world goes by

Of a warm wind through the pines
Her smile can reach the soul of any man

Past the school that has not changed
In all this time
She thinks of when the boy was young
All the battles she had won
Just to give him life

That man

For all his life
But now we meet to take him flowers
And only God knows why
For what's the use in pressing palms
When children fade in mother's arms
It's a cruel world
We've so much to loose
And what we have to learn we rarely choose

So if it's God who took her son
He cannot be the one living in her mind

Take care my love, she said
Don't think that God is dead
Take care my love, she said

You have been loved

If I was weak, forgive me
But I was terrified
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love
The kind that makes devils cry

So these days
My life has changed
And I'll be fine
But she just sits and counts the hours
Searching for her crime
So what's the use of pressing palms
If you won't keep such love from harm
It's a cruel world
You've so much to prove
And heaven helps the ones who wait for you

Yet I envied his assailant
When I visited the shrine
I cried for all those Beatles fans
So old, so quick they grow

And I remain on the far side of crazy

Like a filthy magazine
I stroked the shaft of my guitar
And watched you on the screen

To be all along, a psychopathic poet
The Devil's bastard son

And I remain on the far side of crazy

Can't stay a boy in no man's land

I shot an actor for an actress
But he lived to make a joke
Shot two other men who could have been
The bodies of my folks

I stagger day to day
Plot revenge inside of darkness
I am withering in pain

I had wrists donning slits
Flowing constantly
My broken body in a wreck
Wrapped around a tree
A crosswalk hit-and-run
The finish line for me
People clutter in the gutter
Take a look and see

No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth

My blood flows through the streets
Deluge from the wounds
Empty jars of sleeping pills
On the dresser in my room
My wet-brained neighbor cranes
His neck to see
In time, the white light's, a train
Bearing down on me

So tag my toe and don't forget
Ooh, to close the drawer

And the smell of Honey Suckle on the Mississippi breeze

Thank you for givin' this country boy a place to dream
Thank you for old Cane Pole the fishin' hole
The grits and black eyed peas thank you Missippi for lovin' me
Then my family moved down to Texas when I was 12 years old
I took my first chew of plug tobacco and got hooked on rodeo
I rode my Buckskin pony where the old Red River flows
And my Texas pride still makes me cry when I remember the Alamo
Thank you Texas for loving me thank you for the country road the horny toads
The chile and pinto beans thank you Texas for lovin' me
Now I live up in Wyoming I love home out on the range
But every now and then my mind goes roamin'
Down those country roads through my boy hood days
And after all these years I'd just like to say

phish,tube,1996,"Tube LyricsAn asteroid crashed and nothing burned
It made me wonder:
Do tigers sleep in lily patches?
Do rhinos run from thunder?

I got an ache in my left ear
I felt the truth but I still could hear
Made me think I would not be burned
But rather give myself to science
I felt that I could help
To science, I felt that I could help
Paranoid the doctor ran
Shouting his graphic translation
A fortnight of turmoil
Gang wars and ails of riches
Spewing forth their color
He purposely waited till I was done
To knock on the lavatory door
Accusing me of ruining the fun
He knocked on it some more
The fun, he knocked on it some more

Alloyed suitors drawn inside
An apple or a grape
To put forth a cloud of mercury
He was run over by a car
On a freeway in Los Angeles
Once the spraying has been done
'Cause there's more pain from necessity
You're a portrait of your past
There's a mummy in the cabinet
Are there no more arrows left?

What's that rubber bottle doing here?
How's that napkin for a roof?
Ten cents to a dollar now
For a shelf of pregnant hens

And gams, and gams, and gams

About how love everlasting
Is love at its best
And they dream of that day
When they both ride away

Maybe one less time is all we need
I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge, it's just the farthest that I've ever been

billy bragg,the passion,1986,"The Passion LyricsThe fear of a daughter can run high
In the mind of a father to be
For something is growing inside
But we don't talk about it, do we?

In the long empty passionless night
Many times to herself she has prayed
That the baby will love her much more
Than the big boy who stole her away

And sometimes it takes a grown man a long time to learn
Just what it would take a child a night to learn
And sometimes it takes a grown man a long time to learn
Just what it would take a child a night to learn
It pains her to know that some things will never be right
If the baby is just someone else to take sides in a fight

Harsh words between bride and groom
The distance is greater each day
He smokes alone in the next room
And she knits her life away

And sometimes it takes a grown man a long time to learn
Just what it would take a child a night to learn
And sometimes it takes a grown man a long time to learn
Just what it would take a child a night to learn

A long time ago she saw visions on the stairs
And when she felt dizzy, her mother was always there

billy bragg,levi stubbs' tears,1986,"Levi Stubbs’ Tears LyricsWith the money from her accident
She bought herself a mobile home
So at least she could get some enjoyment
Out of being alone
No one could say that she was left up on the shelf
It's you and me against the World kid she mumbled to herself

Chorus:
When the world falls apart some things stay in place
Levi Stubbs' tears run down his face
She ran away from home in her mother's best coat
She was married before she was even entitled to vote
And her husband was one of those blokes
The sort that only laughs at his own jokes
The sort a war takes away
And when there wasn't a war he left anyway
Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong
Are here to make everything right that's wrong
Holland and Holland and Lamont Dozier too
Are here to make it all okay with you
One dark night he came home from the sea
And put a hole in her body where no hole should be
It hurt her more to see him walking out the door
And though they stitched her back together they left her heart in pieces on the floor

When the world falls apart some things stay in place
She takes off the Four Tops tape and puts it back in its case
When the world falls apart some things stay in place

Of evil, lust and hatred, the roots of every sin
The priest - he stands before them, tells them why they are this way
Why they worship metal gods each and every day
By the hand of Oberon, dark into the deep

Cause I ain't had no lessons in expressin' it right

Toughest thing to do is up and speak my mind
But I've been wantin' you for too long a time

Hurling through the air, exhilarating high
See the Earth below, soon to make a crater

Pickin' my dog up at the pound

But who'll defend the workers who cannot organize
When the bosses send their lackeys out to cheat us?

Who comes to speak for the skin and the bone?

There's still someone out there who
Is meant for only me

What I'm wishing for

Why can't I be as lucky
As those other people are

And stare up at the sky
But I can't give my heart
One good reason why

With everyone but me

Then when you get used to sadness
Free from the confusing madness

So we can share the morning news
Your voice answers our phone when we're not home
Friends who call leave a message here for you
Every night I leave the light on, you're just working late
As far as I can see everything is still the same

And my heart will never know
So I don't fall apart
I fool myself for another day
That you're not really gone
After all this time it's still too hard to let you go
As long as I don't say goodbye
My heart will never know

I'll light a fire when you get home
It reminds me of the first night we make love
Like it would last forever, and nothing could go wrong
You're a part of me, a part of everything I do
So I keep holding on, hiding from the truth

And my heart will never know
So I don't fall apart

You might faint from the fight but you're gonna find it
For every challenge could have paradise behind it
And if you accept what you have lost and you stand tall

She took the TV and the toaster
She took the curtains and the car

I wouldn't take it very hard
And for someone in a hurry
She took her own sweet time

It's what she left behind

That she said throw away
She took my heart and soul
And left me here to lose my mind

But I can't take no more

To get over her goodbye

It's such a small world, New York ain't my town
I don't come around, but once in a while

This is such a surprise to see you
Girl, your looking so good; it's been a long time
Since you've crossed my mind
It's such a small world

Just one night on the town
I came looking around for something to do
Just a change of my plans on leaving
And I stay around and I run into you
Which just goes to prove it's such a small world

It's such a small world
I've lived alone for awhile
It's such a small world
It feels like I've gone out of style

You and me will always be
Just looking for something that's already happened
Years go by but you and I don't have to look beyond today

Maybe just for tonight
We can turn out the light

Lay your heart on the line
Let go of your mind

You know just what to say
You know just what to do

You still look like the day when I first met you

I'll be gone once again come morning
Like I've always done
But to see you tonight

I knew I couldn't stay here by myself
I saw a box and wondered why you'd left it out
Right there on the bedroom closet shelf

Smiling in the blazing Texas sun
It must have been the year before your daddy died
He tried to warn me then this day would come

Wasn't that the guy you told me you forgot
Oh what's his name who never made you laugh
But I never made you smile the way you're smilin' here
By his side in this faded photograph

I wondered bout the guy who dropped you off

Tried busking down in Frisco, tried dancin' in LA
I played the blues in Chicago, boy I ran home in Santa Fe
I played guitar for many men, signed a deal or two
And all I ever got from them is the sho-biz blues

I got hot chicks down in Texas, no work in Alabam'
Snowed in out on Belibor you were always in a jam
Worked carnivals down in Georgia, night clubs attitude
And all I ever got from them is the sho-biz blues
Well the manager's got no money, the bookers had no jobs
The record man he fell asleep, he says I look like a slob
The bus breaks down and the motel's bad you're always in a stew
You can't quit you're too far gone, you got the sho-biz blues

I tried to love the ladies everywhere I went
When I got down and out they wouldn't ever pay my rent
If you crave your neighbour lights, the spotlight's right on you
When it's time to get the catch with the sho-biz blues

Now you can't sleep till two o'clock, you ain't no millionaire
This entertaining lifestyle just seems to go nowhere
You write a song it seems OK, they say it's nothin' new
It don't take long to find you've got the sho-biz bluesEmbed",0.042,0.876,0.082,0.8217

That gives us six until seven to work this out

It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you

You are the moon, I am the sea
You pull me in and gaze on down at me
I was alone, I thought I was immune
It's good to know
The door can still be open wide

If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

It's just the state of the heart
I wait in the dark
In the state I'm in

To falling out or falling in
I go over and over
But I can't change the state
This heart is in

It's just the state of the heart

'Cause the price you have to pay is that the pain won't go away

Did you ever stay too long
With a lover who was over you
You had the feeling it was wrong, so wrong, so wrong
But you loved so hard there's nothing you can do
There are many, many heartaches when you're up against the wall
And all the love you give won't come back at all
And no matter what you do it really hurts to know the truth
Love is unequal sometimes

When you have a change of heart
'Cause you've found that you can trust somebody Trust somebody
They'll tear the arrow from your heart
It's you they'll love it's not just anybody Anybody

boxcar willie,song of songs,1986,"Song Of Songs LyricsHow I love that old melody they are playing
I've heard it in so many different songs
It's made stars of country music singers
And the tune just keeps playing on

Oh, I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes
Seems to me its been around since time began
It was there with our solders during war time
And right today we still hear it now and then

Roy Acuff was a young country singer
Who's record were just starting to be heard
That old tune took him right up to stardom
On the wings of the great speckled bird
Hank Thomson is a country music legend
He sang western swing and songs of grief and strife
That same tune gave Hank the break he needed

On a record called the wild side of life

A young girl made the world stop and listen
Kitty Wells was that young singers name
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
That melody ran clear as country rain

Those note must have came straight out of heaven
In so many different songs they were the same
I know someday they'll be etched in gold forever
And placed in the country music hall of fame

And placed in the country music

In Europe and America
There’s a growing feeling of hysteria
Conditioned to respond to all the threats
In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets
Mr. Khrushchev said we will bury you
I don’t subscribe to this point of view
It would be such an ignorant thing to do
If the Russians love their children too

How can I save my little boy
From Oppenheimer's deadly toy?
There is no monopoly of common sense
On either side of the political fence

Regardless of ideology

I hope the Russians love their children too

There is no historical precedent
To put the words in the mouth of the president
There’s no such thing as a winnable war

And tiptoed out upon the highest wire
The truth to tell upon a rope too thin
And so the fall of treachery begins
But oh to see the starlet's smiling face
So eagerly awaits to take the place

You could have said I would have given way

And I see him smile the way that I smiled
And I hear him laugh the way that I did
But I hear him screaming and I hear him cry

Waking up with a head full of bed
Full of what she said

And when she did, she thought of it differently
Than she thought she should be thinking
Just the thought of it's enough
To penetrate my comfort zone

Pale September, I wore the time like a dress that year
The autumn days swung soft around me like cotton on my skin
But as the embers of the summer lost their breath and disappeared
My heart went cold and only hollow rhythms resounded from within
But then he rose, brilliant as the moon in full
And sank in the burrows of my keep

And all my armor falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep
[Verse 2]
He goes along just as a water lily
Gentle on the surface of his thoughts, his body floats
Unweighed down by passion or intensity
Yet unaware of the depth upon which he coasts
And he finds a home in me
For what misfortune sows, he knows my touch will reap

[Chorus]
And all my armour falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep

And I'm tired of keeping a low profile

johnny cash,redemption,1994,"Redemption LyricsFrom his hands it came down, from the side it came down
From the feet it came down and ran to the ground
Between heaven and hell, a teardrop fell
In the deep crimson dew, the tree of life grew

[Chorus]
And the blood gave life to the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price that set the captives free
And the numbers that came through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree and were redeemed by the blood
From the tree streamed a light that started the fight
'Round the tree grew a vine on whose fruit I could dine
My old friend Lucifer came, fought to keep me in chains
But I saw through the tricks of six-sixty-six

[Chorus]
And the blood gave life to the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price that set the captives free
And the numbers that came through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree and were redeemed by the blood

From his hands it came down, from his side it came down
From his feet it came down and ran to the ground
And a small inner voice said ""you do have a choice""
The vine engrafted me and I clung to the tree2Embed",0.056,0.877,0.067,0.5647

She was watching me watching her
I was singin' about an old flame burning
She was hanging on to every word

I was pouring out my feelings
She was pouring out the wine
Through the smoke and the beer
It was perfectly clear
That we were touching each others minds
It was love ten feet away
Imagine her in my arms, with that look on her face
Lying somewhere in some shadowy place
It was love just ten feet away

I just knew my closing song would do it
I knew that I was heaven bound
I could tell she was moved, but before I was through
This stranger walked up and set down

He was trying his best to impress her
But she never took her eyes off me
When he got up and left, I said to myself...
Woh-o-woh what a night this will be

And stand'em on their heads

No prima donna ways

Remember when Mr. Barnum
Presented Jenny Lind
They named a candy after her
A circus after him

He lived quietly
He needed her, she needed him
As sure as the sky above
In a way it was for them

Always makes me turn around
Won't leave me alone

A monkey and a kid
Followed by those two one-armed jugglers
The ego and the id

Apples of the sun
There is no rhyme or reason
Just a time for each and every one

Where eternity begins
We will let it all hangout

Is it so wrong to be human after all?

No one can say that we didn't feel

Gone, fragile but free

I've spent my life following things I can not see

I found out that without fail they lead me to your door
And the world keeps turning round and round

My heart keeps turning upside down
And you're still standin' there
Lately I see all the signs
I feel it in the wind
The same thing happens every time that you come back again
I admit that there are nights
When I sit up and cry
But sometimes I turn out the lights and pray you'll pass me by
And the world keeps turning round and round
It leaves me hanging in the air
My heart keeps turning upside down
And you're still standin' there
Since you're gone my empty arms have nothing left to hold

And stage your celebration just to show how much you care
You obscure your stolen power with hypocrisy and lies
Your talk of understanding is a wafer thin disguise
You glorify my image but deny me flesh and blood
You radiate with goodness when you here me beg for food

Didn't give you minutes, not even moments
All my life in a tower of foil
Shaded feelings, I don't believe you

When you were there before my eyes
No one planned it, took it for granted

I count the hours since you slipped away
I count the hours that I lie awake
I count the minutes and the seconds too
All I stole and I took from you
But Bonny, don't live at home
Bonny, don't live at home
Words don't hold you, broken soldiers

All my silence and my strained respect
Missed chances and the same regrets
Kiss the thief and you save the rest
All my insights from retrospect

But Bonny, don't live at home

Come outta there, boy
Don't you know that house is haunted?
There's an old deserted mansion on an old forgotten road
Where the better ghosts and goblins always hang out
One night they threw a party tn a manner a la mode
And they cordially invited all the gang out
At a dark, bewitchin' hour when the fun was loud and hearty
A notorious wall flower became the life of the party
Mmm, the spooks were havin' their midnight fling
The merry makin' was in full swing
They shrieked themselves into a cheerful trance
When the skeleton in the closet started to dance
Now a goblin giggled with fiendish glee
A shout rang out from a big banshee
Amazement was in every ghostly glance
When the skeleton in the closet started to dance
All the witches were in stitches while his steps made rhythmic thumps
And they nearly dropped their broomsticks when he tried to do the bumps
You never heard such unearthly laughter, such hilarious groans
When the skeleton in the closet rattled his bonesEmbed",0.037,0.802,0.161,0.9794

Harlem has come to bid farewell
To one of its brightest hopes
Extinguished now and gone from us, forever

For Harlem is where he worked
And where he struggled and fought
His home of homes, where his heart was
And where his people are

And it is, therefore, most fitting
That we meet once again in Harlem
To share these last moments with him
The black man. Black!
For Harlem has ever been gracious
To those who have loved her, have fought for her
And have defended her honor
Even to the death

It is not in the memory of man that this beleaguered, unfortunate
But nonetheless, proud community has found a braver
More gallant, young champion
Than this Afro-American, who lies before us

Did he ever touch you?
Did you have him smile at you?
Did you ever really listen to him?

Now if Manhattan turns you on
Do what you gotta do
Don't worry how I'll make it without you

I'll just here on the porch
And wait here for the breeze
To whisper your name through the willow trees

That all these killers should be killed
And all these healers should be healed

And let that perverted thought really run through my mind?
Through my mind

I'd scrape my toes across the floor
This day's the same as those before
And though, inside, I'm feeling giddy
Always wrong for never giving myself that un-invaded door
So, now I'll take a little glue
I'll put together a new glittered room for view

So I can start sitting so pretty
Instead of sitting here not seein' clear
Just sitting here, not fittin' here
No, things ain't fittin' here

In a club in San Anton'
Both of us were lonely
Had no one to call our own

So we danced and laughed
'Til closing time
And had no place to go
So with the top pulled down
We drove all night
Ran off to Mexico
But my blond-haired, blue-eyed cowboy
Turned out to be bad news
Disappeared one morning
Left his old boots and the blues

Now there's been so many others
But none of them were true
The only one I could count on
To keep me company is you

Oh, it's you again
Never really wanted us
To be such friends

You always seem to show up
When I'm all alone
That's when you move right in
And make yourself at home

That I'd have learned

Never knowing I could feel

I've been to hell. I spell it...I spell it DMV

Stood there, and I've waited and choked back the urge to scream
And if I had my druthers, I'd screw a chimpanzee
Call it pointless

Perhaps you may know vaguely what I mean
I sit back and smoke away huge chunks of memory
As I slowly inflict upon myself a full lobotomy
Call it pointless
Pointless

I want somebody to share, share the rest of my life
Share my innermost thoughts, know my intimate details
Someone who'll stand by my side and give me support
And in return, she'll get my support
She will listen to me when I want to speak
About the world we live in and life in general
Though my views may be wrong, they may even be perverted
She'll hear me out and won't easily be converted
To my way of thinking, in fact, she'll often disagree
But at the end of it all, she will understand me
[Verse 2]
I want somebody who cares for me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things in a different light
All the things I detest I will almost like
I don't want to be tied to anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear of those things
But when I'm asleep I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly
Though things like this make me sick
In a case like this, I'll get away with it6Embed",0.06,0.729,0.212,0.9839

But here we are, a bridge too far

How can it be, these changes in me

Nothing lasts forever, that's true
Take a look at the world that we once knew
Gone are the feelings that once we could hold on to
Chorus:
Try to forgive me, find a way to believe me
I'm hurting the same way too
Oh I know it's not easy, but baby believe me
We've been fighting this war far too long
Where did we go wrong

I tried to write a letter, but it's better this way
Here in this place, face to face
Let's not forsake the future in view of the past
So little gained and far too much pain

Trying to compromise our points of view
We leave each other feeling blue
Gone are the feelings that once would have seen us through

From televison beams

And Govermental Goons don't care
I know that I shall not despair
And CHEAT like ALL THE REST

With what I do the best!

In a little town down south
There's a little clapboard house
With a wolf outside the door
In the bedroom there's a light
That's been staying on all night
For at least a month or more
The heartaches and the bills keep coming due
And with all they're going through

[Chorus]
It's no small miracle that love hangs on
Hearts get weary when hope is gone
In a world where roses wither and die
It's no small miracle when love survives
[Verse 2]
It's been uphill for a while
But he still makes her smile
Every now and then
Lately they've been finding' out
It's the little things that count
And they do what they can
He tells her he loves her every day
She says things will be okay

As monuments wither beyond recognition
Under the march of modern slavery

The elegance of irony
A sight to behold
Hopefully, it enlightens other worlds
Between light and dark
Between recognition and obscurity
Between oblivion and repression
Certainty is lurking, waiting
No hymns of praise will sound
The yoke of silence will fall
No light will come from the sun
Bones to ashes, souls to dust

His body be steel, his words falling bombs
Bring forth a daughter, her name be famine

Says South Dakota, U.S.A
Grass plains stretch to the horizon
Not a soul can be found on them

Purple paint peels but fails to reveal
The bitterness that grows inside
Cloud of dust in the distance

Than to have words misunderstood?

He showed her how to kick the gong around

Now, she had a dream about the king of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin'
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with a platinum wheel

Now, he gave her his townhouse and his racing horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses;
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
And she sat around and counted them all a billion times

The things they do, the things they say
But baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears
I'll chase away those restless fears
And turn your blue skies into grey

Behind my back they knew
Never saw it coming - but my world came crashing down
They gamble on your future - play the coldest game in town
What I've lost in a lifetime
Mistakes it's made me see
What's still in my heart
They can't take that away from me
Beyond all my frusration - there's a fire deep inside
It's been there since I started - I got nothing left to hide
As I climb the stairway - for a piece of higher ground
This time I'm looking straight ahead
Cause it's dangerous looking down
Like a fool I'd been waiting - until you came along
You made a blind man see
Your love made all the difference
And nobody.... can't take that away from me

Tell me, please, which way to turn
To find myself again

Send me please some peace of mind
Take away this pain

Deep into affliction of my hollow mind

Untying the lasting few cords of common sense
Submerged into the flow

It took my breath away
That doesn’t happen every day

Manhattan’s music, man
On every avenue
You’ve heard no greater sound
Too much can get you down

Decorate, paint it for the union
No reason to give up on the illusion
Take confident possession of yourself
No reason to give up on the illusion
Venice is sinking fast
Looks almost upside down
Under a spell we fell
There’s more, too much to tell

Decorate, paint it for the union
No reason to give up on the illusion
Take confident possession of yourself
No reason to give up on the illusion

Beneath Chicago moon
Spend every dollar saved
As much as we have made

Two are born to cross
Their paths, their lives, their hearts
If by chance one turns away
Are they forever lost?
I guess I believe that there's a point
To what we do
But I ask myself is there
Something more besides you?

This morning I awoke
The bed warm where it once was cold
Small blessings laid upon us
Small mysteries slowly unfold

Yet I still wonder is there a point
To what we do?

That there is something more besides you

A helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care

Born in the splendor of God's holy vision
And sliding away like a tear down his face
The closer you see the whole, wide, holy wonder
Of oceans and mountains and rivers and trees
And the strangest creation of many: the human
A creature of laughter and freedom and dreams

And preachers are preaching the gospel of hate
By their behaviour they're determined to teach us
A lesson we're soon to be learning too late

While she is waiting

She knows the dangers there,these love affairs
Run hot, run cold and always take their toll
It's another lonely night inside those empty rooms
She knows will never be a home
There must be another way to spend her life

She's on her knees
One from the heart, that's all she needs

To the other side through the curtain wall
In the circle of trees
Beyond the prison cells

Faces staring back
Piercing through skin
From the wood panel
From the other side
In the house of undead souls
Voices carried through the wind
From the mountains in the dead of night
Besieged by the hand of doom
Staring into dead black eyes

Sound waves of hate
Light beams that devastate
Rooms of confusion
Thick, black mass

The dead of night draws nigh
Fall under the spell of the seven songs
Cast into the void of irrelevance
Forever drawn to obscurity

Hand in hand we enter
The portal to hell

Something will come back
But we will never return
We will never heal
Tainted by those
That inhabit those rooms
That never rests

To cast divine arrows into her soul
To grab her attention swift and quick
Or morrow the marrow of her bones be thick
With turpentine kisses and mistaken blows

See the Devil may do as the Devil may care
He loves none sweeter as sweeter the dare

Her heart the captive of which he speaks
So note all ye lovers in love with the sound
Your world be shattered with nary a note
Of one Cupid's arrow under your coat

And you look to the north and a pale moon is rising
And it seems like all is dying and would leave the world to mourn;
In the distance hear her laughter

And you shouldn't be afraid for
Every time it rains it rains

All over town

Hoping it'd help me get over
The night that you left
But it didn't help
So I moved on to tequila
Built a pyramid up to the ceiling
Ten glasses high
But I can still hear you saying goodbye

[Chorus]
It's going to take more than a margarita
More than a shooter
To blow your memory away
I still need you
I'm hurting without you
Even when I'm feeling no pain
[Verse 2]
Well, tonight I'm the life of the party
Joking about my broken heart
But it's easy to see
The joke's on me
That waitress just asked how I want it
With or without the salt on it
I shook my head
Either way ain't going to make me forget
