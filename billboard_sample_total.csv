Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl (Girl)

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me

Billboard bebeğim, Dua Lipa gelirken onları dans ettir
Herkes koşacak bir dans pisti arıyor

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Eğer benimle kaçmak istiyorsan, bir galaksi biliyorum
Ve seni gezmeye götürebilirim
İçimde ritme kapılacağımıza dair bir his var
Müziğin ömür boyu durmadığı bir yerde
Parıltı gökyüzünde, parıltı gözlerimde
Tam istediğim gibi parlıyor
Eğer bir ortağa ihtiyacın olduğunu düşünüyorsan
Benimle mükemmel zamanda tanıştın
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Sen beni istiyorsun, ben seni istiyorum, bebeğim
Şekerim, havaya uçuyorum
Samanyolu, kaçıyoruz
Evet, evet, evet, evet, evet

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Yakladım seni, ay ışığı, sen benim yıldız ışığımsın
Bütün gece sana ihtiyacım var, hadi, benimle dans et
Havalara uçuyorum
Sen, ay ışığı, sen benim yıldız ışığımsın (Sen ay ışığısın)
Bütün gece sana ihtiyacım var, hadi, benimle dans et
Havalara uçuyorum

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Ben en iyilerindeyim, tartışılacak bir şey yok (Hadi)
Hala uçuyorum, ağır ilaç etkisindeyim
İronik, Ben onlara aşk veriyorum sonunda yine benden nefret ediyorlar (Git)
Kız bana söyledi beni seviyormuş ve beklemiş
Senin aşkın için çabalıyordum ve sabrım tükeniyor
Sarılacak birine ihtiyacım var, temele bile döndüm
Görüyor musun bana neler yaptırdığını (Evet)
Beni yerimden edebilirler, ama kimse bu eylemi durduramaz
Uh-uh, hadi
Sol ayak, sağ ayak, uçuyorum (Hadi)
Pop Yıldızları (Git), Dua Lipa ve DaBaby
Peşinde olduğum tüm nimetler için ayakkabılarımı bağlamak zorunda kaldım (Git)
Eğer düşersem, daha iyi bir durumda olurum
Yani yetiş, daha iyisin yap
Kalk ve parayı kovala (Evet, evet)
Hep terk ederler düştüğünde, ama beraber koşarsınız (Hey)
Dünyanın ağırlığı omuzlarımda, başımı dik tutuyorum
Şimdi, bebek, aya kalk, çünkü, kız, sen

Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do

Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

Remember when you swore to God I was the only

Billboard bebeğim, Dua Lipa gelirken onları dans ettir
Herkes koşacak bir dans pisti arıyor

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Eğer benimle kaçmak istiyorsan, bir galaksi biliyorum
Ve seni gezmeye götürebilirim
İçimde ritme kapılacağımıza dair bir his var
Müziğin ömür boyu durmadığı bir yerde
Parıltı gökyüzünde, parıltı gözlerimde
Tam istediğim gibi parlıyor
Eğer bir ortağa ihtiyacın olduğunu düşünüyorsan
Benimle mükemmel zamanda tanıştın
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Sen beni istiyorsun, ben seni istiyorum, bebeğim
Şekerim, havaya uçuyorum
Samanyolu, kaçıyoruz
Evet, evet, evet, evet, evet

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Yakladım seni, ay ışığı, sen benim yıldız ışığımsın
Bütün gece sana ihtiyacım var, hadi, benimle dans et
Havalara uçuyorum
Sen, ay ışığı, sen benim yıldız ışığımsın (Sen ay ışığısın)
Bütün gece sana ihtiyacım var, hadi, benimle dans et
Havalara uçuyorum

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Ben en iyilerindeyim, tartışılacak bir şey yok (Hadi)
Hala uçuyorum, ağır ilaç etkisindeyim
İronik, Ben onlara aşk veriyorum sonunda yine benden nefret ediyorlar (Git)
Kız bana söyledi beni seviyormuş ve beklemiş
Senin aşkın için çabalıyordum ve sabrım tükeniyor
Sarılacak birine ihtiyacım var, temele bile döndüm
Görüyor musun bana neler yaptırdığını (Evet)
Beni yerimden edebilirler, ama kimse bu eylemi durduramaz
Uh-uh, hadi
Sol ayak, sağ ayak, uçuyorum (Hadi)
Pop Yıldızları (Git), Dua Lipa ve DaBaby
Peşinde olduğum tüm nimetler için ayakkabılarımı bağlamak zorunda kaldım (Git)
Eğer düşersem, daha iyi bir durumda olurum
Yani yetiş, daha iyisin yap
Kalk ve parayı kovala (Evet, evet)
Hep terk ederler düştüğünde, ama beraber koşarsınız (Hey)
Dünyanın ağırlığı omuzlarımda, başımı dik tutuyorum
Şimdi, bebek, aya kalk, çünkü, kız, sen

Sen beni istiyorsun, ben seni istiyorum, bebeğim
Şekerim, havaya uçuyorum

Bütün gece sana ihtiyacım var, hadi, benimle dans et

Bu gece benimle uzaklara uçabilirsin
Bu gece benimle uzaklara uçabilirsin
Bebeğim, bırak seni gezmeye götüreyim

Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Bridge]
We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you59Embed",0.199,0.711,0.09,-0.9958
Leave The Door Open,Silk Sonic (Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak),2021-07-17,"Leave The Door Open Lyrics[Intro: Bruno Mars]
Say baby, say baby, say baby

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars]
What you doin'? (What you doin'?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Oh, you got plans? (You got plans)
Don't say that (Shut your trap)
I'm sippin' wine (Sip, sip) in a robe (Drip, drip)
I look too good (Look too good)
To be alone (Woo, woo)
My house clean (House clean), my pool warm (Pool warm)
Just shaved, smooth like a newborn
We should be dancin', romancin'
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
(Tell me that you're comin' through)

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars]
Ooh, you're so sweet (So sweet), so tight (So tight)
I won't bite (Uh-uh), unless you like (Unless you like)
If you smoke (What you smoke?), I got the haze (Purple haze)
And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (Woo)
Ooh, baby, don't keep me waitin'
There's so much love we could be makin' (Shamone!)
I'm talkin' kissin', cuddlin'
Rose petals in the bathtub
Girl, let's jump in, it's bubblin'

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms (If you tryna lay in these arms)
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')

And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through (Come on, girl)

Ooh (Ooh)
Na-na, yeah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

[Refrain: The Weeknd & Ariana Grande]
I don't know why I run away (Oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Ariana Grande]
Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Mm)

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
I don't know why I run away, oh boy (Run away, oh yeah; oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Away, oh; oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Oh)

Deja Vu,Olivia Rodrigo,2021-07-17,"​deja vu Lyrics[Verse 1]
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
[Bridge]
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
