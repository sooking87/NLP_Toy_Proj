frankie laine,i believe,1950,"I Believe Lyrics[Verse 1]
I believe for every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows

I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way
I believe, I believe

[Verse 2]
I believe above the storm, the smallest prayer
Will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe

If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye
It's no secret you'll feel better if you cry
When waking from a bad dream
Don't you sometimes think it's real?
But it's only false emotions that you feel

If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go on and cry
If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Well, now, remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky

I remember the nights when all alone we sang Sweet Adeline*

But they can't fill the places or ever be like the old pals of yesterday

There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""Son what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
The scaffold was high and eternity nears
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

Take a deep breath
Dust yourself off
And start all over again

Nothing's impossible, I have found
For when my chin is on the ground
I pick myself up
Dust myself off
And start all over again
Don't lose your confidence
If you slip
Be grateful for a pleasant trip
And pick yourself up
Dust yourself off
And start all over again

Work like a soul inspired
Until the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired
But you'll be a man, my son

Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again
They picked themselves up
Dust themselves off
And start'd all over again

Work like a soul inspired
Till the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired
But you'll be a man, my son

Who had to fall to rise again?

Got to wed her right now, or face a slaughter!'

The love light that you spoke about was only just a flame
Cause every tome you meet a man it lights right up again

I loaded wife and kids and dogs and then I pulled up stakes
Back home here in the old home 'stead I've kept him by my side
And filled him with my Appalachian pride

Thankful we had this to come back to
We don't have much money, but we're dignified
And happy in our Appalachian pride
There's hell mud in the smoke house, some flower in the ban
Molasis, cans and beans until crop comes in
The kids back in that bedroom, they finally understand
The pride of an Appalachian man

Now we don't live on welfare, we don't need the checks no more
We got sick of bill collectors a-banging on the door
We'll break our backs from dusk till dawn and God is on our side

And a feller on an old banjo, and the man of the fiddle

How I wish you'd ask me now
I was vain and bind then
Prone to be unkind then
Wish they'd turn back time somehow
Then I was audacious
I ignored what was precious
How I wish you'd ask me now
I thought then I'd always be
Footloose and fancy free
How could I have been so blind
What I once made light of turned out to be true lve
Once my ego ruled me
Flattered me and fooled me
More times than the laws allow
You asked me could I care
My attention was elsewhere
How I wish you'd ask me nowEmbed",0.115,0.681,0.204,0.9301

I tried so hard, my dear to show
That you're my every dream
Yet, you're afraid each thing I do
Is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart

[Chorus: Tim McGraw,  Tony Bennett & Tim McGraw]
Another love before my time
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now
For things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said
That make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart

Like a bubble in a glass of champagne

You go to my head

And I find the very mention of you
Like a kicker in a julep or two
The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me

Still I say to myself
""Get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be, yes""

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance

tony bennett,i wanna be loved,1952,"Review of Lady Gaga: 2014 LyricsWelcome to the Manifesto of Mother Monster! Or not so much for the leader of all monsters...

For this year Lady Gaga, went down to her memory lane just by making a jazzy project. ""Cheek To Cheek"". Which is cannot be missed. For the legion of monsters and general listeners still may find her outrageous, AGAIN, but not with the looks. But the electro-pop artist who came in full strong motion from making hits of bizarre rights, religion and countries in Born This Way, to the pleasing effort of bring Pop Culture and Classical Art together with Number #1 album 'ARTPOP' made the move this time with one of the best Jazz artist of all time, a sixteen time Grammy winner and one of the most prestigious: Tony Bennett. Not only the genre-difference, and art-differance, but we all find it weird somehow that how they came along: which words can't define. Just ODD according to Time's issue of August. We're glad both of them have unbelievable vocal range and abilities. But the couple knows Brooklyn much better than its native, perhaps and their Italian-American Accent is what the sweet taste comes in between the bizarre couple. We would always think and remember the old Gaga back in The Fame Era, which and whom we thought was just any other NYC make up gal, workin' it off, with just a modern 21st century looks. NO! Gaga returns with The Fame Monster EP with a bit of lack of normal-'ness' to it, which we find...er..a bit fine, we came to knew her as a beautiful person with the infamous meat dress, wearing fifties and hundreds of Kermit's' and the undefinable music videos of 'Bad Romance' and 'Telephone'. You started calling her eccentric, I started calling her eccentric, she stated herself eccentric. But the eccentric got much better with 'The Monster Ball' tour and the release of the single Born This Way. Anyway, we all know how's Gaga been there and did that

But what really is heart-touching is that, those support that Tony gave her, just after the release of the music video 'Marry The Night' and 'Yoü and I' when Gaga got unbelievably addicted to marijuana. Perhaps this Encore of the Born This Way Era was more sad, personal and dark for her. Also mention us, the good part: Gaga is an original Italian-American Jazz artist from heart and professionally for technical terms of the album. On interview with Good Morning America, Gaga mentioned how her senior high school year was like when she got into TSG band with her teen friends and listening to classics and Jazz 24/7! Personally, it's just that we all have a classic roots, no matter how outrageous we act

On 2014, Gaga's fashion took place in a sophisticated and delightful way, referring herself as a 'Chameleon'...'Machete Kills' anyone? One of the biggest changes comes into Gaga's fashion: During a visit in London, the singer showed us the girl behind the Aura by showing off her real dark brunette hair to the public faces. Again in the 'Drunky Ga-Ga' concert of 'iTunes Presents: Lady GaGa on #SwineFest' she flipped her Marina and Aphrodite inspired wig off and slowly, yet artistically opening her wig-cap, speechifying 'This is my real hair...I hided it all the time, because I just didn't wanted to show how I am from the inside, it was burqa to me and I still respect the as much as my fame' getting emotional, Gaga gets on Piano to perform swine and 'I Wanna Be With You'. Next day Gaga got out of her hotel naked feet again' with her 'real hair', without posing cameras, Gaga takes each step slower than a seal, with artistic movements, half-way to the transport' cameras caught Gaga shedding tears. Gaga also made a small meditation video which features herself meditating through her vocals, naked..for a fundraiser. Gaga came in a twenty-nine minutes special on the 'BBC: Culture Show', which involved her behind the scenes, arrival at London, speeches, innovation, the clean version of the meditation, and a fascinating yet INTENSE 10 minutes personal interview. Alongside showing her real hair, Gaga's been loving and wearing gowns most of the time, or otherwise fringed clothing and under-garments. Gaga's been channeling Amy Winehouse recently, from July. Also comes in, the exotic and pleasing choices of her Afro wigs, Beyoncé's bangs and curls, alongside with the iconic Amy Winehouse high towered ponytailed hair. Gaga's got wacky with her eye though. The singer had been recently seen wearing bizarre and 'heavy' eye accessories, from metal hooks to steel. Mentioning tattoos, the singer got on at her left shoulder back which figures the friendly-iconic 'monsters claw and another just a few inches below written 'Little monsters'

On personal life, it is confirmed confirmed that her engagement with Taylor Kinney is complete, and they're officially committed to each-other. Though we are not excited and nor looking for any events to take place in 2015 with Gaga's being busy on the 'Cheek To Cheek Tour' and Taylor Kinney with 'Chicago Fires'. Big news on her life right now is her new mansion which she bought in Malibu, California, just seaside which is claimed to be $24 million, it comes with five custom garages, six bedroom, bowling area, bonfire, luxurious pools, a BATCAVE and a WINERY

Gaga's won a Guinness world record again for 2015 of being the most powerful pop star alive! She's been voted again one of the most influential artists and Cheek To Cheek has got to number one in 21 countries! Congrats Tony and Gaga. By the way, did I mention Gaga's not completely into the 'Cheek To Cheek Tour'. It's official that Gaga is the first pop artist to perform in SPACE. The craft is one it's way, I'll mention it later, but we know it is definite, that it is crafted by NASA
A very little is known for Gaga in late 2015 and early 2016. We're ""hopping"" for another Gagalicious album while she is 'hoping'. Though it is confirmed Gaga will be performing CBS Thanskgiving special and Christmas special this month, so she won't still be able to explore her new mansion

The ArtRave Ball comes to an end, releasing 'Cake Like Lady Gaga' unofficially, and 'PARTYNAUSEOUS' as an ""Artrave theme and devoted"" single available worldwide

We will see you in space singing Venus that will be broadcasted live worldwide! Can't wait for you Gaga. Much love2Embed",0.032,0.811,0.157,0.9995

count basie,why not,1952,"Bad Post Lyricswow I totally agree. you should add me bro. and check me out :)
Listen if you want a funny number you can count in a different base, like maybe 6 or 36. If you understand these numbers, they are just as simple to read as base 10 numbers, and it's often practical to count in a certain base. No kidding! In base six, it's easy to see patterns emerging in the prime numbers, they are always ending in 1 or 5, 6n+1 or 6n-1, but no one yet has found a formula for all prime numbers, and 6n+1 or 6n-1 also describe non-primes.
If you want a really big number, though, and check this out, because I'm about to blow your mind. Essentially if you buy that time has time, and time's time has time etc, you can mathematically model an infinite number of collapsing dimensions around a fixed volume of physical, observable space. you can take the fixed volume and multiply it by the time it exists. Say for instance you have a house with 5 units of volume and it exists for 70 years. 70*5=350 units of space-time-line. But if time has time, and if space-time-line has area and volume, (We can't observe this phenomena, but just assume for the sake of the math because the numbers are about to get huge.) then we can take the space-time-volume (350*350*350=5 big units) and use that value as the edge of a line in some further dimension. Then we can use some already known massive number like Graham's number, for instance. Look that one up because this is already a huge number that requires its own notation because it's so big, but if we use this huge number as an operator on our cubic function, or why not go for broke, after all time-time-time-time-time-time is so far beyond human understanding, it's really just a mathematical model now, so lets not use the cubic function, let's use x raised 500 times, and lets apply the same concept of using the output for the next input and do that graham's number of times.

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Just walking, talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderlandEmbed",0.078,0.788,0.134,0.9321

The Devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""
""I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.""
[Pre-Chorus]
The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

[Chorus]
Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

[Verse 2]
The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:
[Demonic violin piece]

[Verse 3]
When the Devil finished, Johnny said, ""Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""

""Fire on the Mountain"" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no
[Non-demonic violin piece]

[Verse 4]
The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.""
And he played:

In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town
Sat a boy and his guitar
And the people came from miles around
And all the girls from there to Austin
Were slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock
To take the trip, to go and listen
To the little dark-haired boy
That played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play
Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle
And he never cared to make a dime
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time
And all the girls from nine to ninety
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes
And begging him don't stop
And hypnotized and fascinated
By the little dark-haired boy
That played the Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him around
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town
But all the girls still dreamed about him
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked
And then one day on the Hit Parade
Was a little dark-haired boy

Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John

[Verse 2]
Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, he just said, ""Hi"" to Big John

[Verse 3]
Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John

[Verse 4]
Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

[Verse 5]
Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John
[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 6]
And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, ""There's a light up above""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John

[Verse 7]
With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John

Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it

That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while
Hospitality, they were good to me
I couldn't spend a dime and had the grandest time

I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear
They had a fellow named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed
All them boys began to play in real harmony
I never will forget that tune they call
Handy's Memphis Blues, oh yes, those blues
They've got a trumpet man leading the band
And folks, he sure blow some horn
And when the clarinet seconds to the trombones croon
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day

That melancholy strain that ever haunting refrain
Is like a morning sorrow song

Was sent to the jail house yesterday
But late last night he made his getaway

He was long gone from Kentucky
Long gone, ain't he lucky?
Long gone, what I mean
A long gone John from Bowlin' Green

Waitin' for freight train to come by

At San Quentin they jailed him one evening late
But out on the ocean, John did escape
'Cause the guards forgot to close the Golden Gate

He was long gone from Kentucky
Long gone, ain't he lucky?
Long gone, what I mean
A long gone John from Bowlin' Green

While they offered a reward to bring him back
Even put bloodhounds on his track
Those doggone bloodhounds lost his scent
Now nobody knows where John went

He was long gone from Kentucky
Long gone, ain't he lucky?
Long gone, what I mean
A long gone John from Bowlin' Green
A gang of men tried to capture Dean
So they chased him with a submarine
Dean jumped overboard and grabbed the submarine
And made that gang catch a flyin' machine

Gone astray

Has run off and undone you

Has seen its final inning

For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will
Be the same

Every trick of his you're on to
But fools will be fools
And where's he gone to

The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he may turn up

Oh, to see a mountain covered with a quilt of snow

What is Christmas with no snow
No white Christmas with no snow
Snow

I'll soon be there with snow
I'll wash my hair with snow
And with a spade of snow
I'll build a man that's made of snow
I'd love to stay up with you but I recommend a little shuteye
Go to sleep
And dream

Does the sky look rainful?

You can overcome
A long face gets you nowhere
You will lose that month of May
Like Peter Pan
The sweeter pan
Wins the day

Go long and get that long face lost

Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues
And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues

And the dark shadows creep
And then your lived ones
Are gathered to weep

I tried so, not to give in
I said to myself this affair, it never will go so well
But why should I try to resist, when baby I know damn well
That I've got you, under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time I do just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin
Because I've got you, under my skinEmbed",0.13,0.812,0.058,-0.9359

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory evergreen

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part
What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like a dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
And we suddenly know what heaven we're in

To see someone in such a stew for me
And when you say you'll do all you could for me
It's so good for me it's bad for me

Completely left on the shelf
But since you started to woo me
I'm just crazy about myself
It's a boon for me a break for me
To hear that your heart's on the make for me
Yet no matter however appealing
I still have a feeling it's bad for me

Though I'm in love, I'm not above
A date with a duke or a caddie
It's just a pose, 'cause my baby knows
That my heart belongs to daddy

When some good scout, invites me out
To dine on some fine fin and haddie
My baby's sure, his love is secure
Cause my heart belongs to daddy

Yes my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad

In the warm summer sunshine
There is the rock
That you dared me to climb
Darling, that was the place
Where we shared an embrace
For the very first time

Yes, the rock still stands
On the soft soft sands
And it's more than my heart can bear

Why do I still dream of that storybook ending?
When will my heart ever learn?
Why do I sit here pretending
That you will, that you will, that you will return?

With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love

I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingué traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales
[Bridge]
Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

[Verse 2]
Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my, —side my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest

A stranger lying on a bar room floor
Had drank so much he could drink no more
So he fell asleep with a troubled brain
To dream that he rode on that downbound train

[Verse 2]
The engine with blood was sweaty and damp
And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp
And imps for fuel was shoveling bones
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans
[Verse 3]
The boiler was filled with lager beer
The devil himself was the engineer
The passengers were most a motley crew
Some were foreigners and others he knew
Rich men in broadcloth, beggars in rags
Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags

[Verse 4]
As the train rushed on at a terrible pace
Sulphuric fumes scorched their hands and face
Wider and wider the country grew
Faster and faster the engine flew
Louder and louder the thunder crashed
Brighter and brighter the lightning flashed
Hotter and hotter the air became
Till their clothes were burned and they were screaming with pain
Then out of the distance, there came a yell
""Ha ha"", said the devil, ""We're nearing home""
Oh how the passengers shrieked with pain
And begged old Satan to stop that train

[Verse 5]
The stranger awoke with an anguished cry
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high
He fell on his knees on the bar room floor
And prayed a prayer like never before
And the prayers and vows were not in vain

You won't believe me and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

blossom dearie,they say it's spring,1957,"They Say It’s Spring LyricsWhen I was young I lived in a world of dreams

Of moods and myths and illusionary schemes

Though now I'm much more grown up

I fear that I must own up

To the fact that I'm in doubt of

What the modern cynics shout of
They say it's spring

This feeling light as a feather

They say this thing

This magic we share together

Came with the weather too

They say it's May

That's made me daft as a daisy

It's May, they say

That gave the whole world this crazy

Heavenly, hazy hue

I'm a lark

On the wing

I'm the spark of a firefly's fling
Yet to me

This must be

Something more than a seasonal thing

Could it be spring

Those bells that I can hear ringing

It may be spring

But when the robins stop singing

You're what I'm clinging to

Though they say it's spring

It's you

If poets sing

That when a hard sympathetic

It's merely spring
Then poets plights are pathetic

Though I'm poetic too

They say it's spring

For lovers, there's where the lure is

That evil thing

For which September the cure is

This, they are sure is true

Though I know

That it's so

That my fancy may turn in the spring

With the right

One in sight

One can find a perpetual thing

Did I need spring

To bring the ring that you bought me

Though it was spring

That wondrous day that you caught me

Darling I thought we knew

That it wasn't spring

Saddle up and ride, you lonesome cowboy
Here is where you'll find your destiny (destiny)

Near to me and yet so far
Will I always be a lonesome cowboy
Am I only reaching for a star?

Were searchin' for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon
As only they can . .

They started swayin' to and fro . . 
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues
Really began . . 
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singin' weird melodies
And they made that
The start of the blues!

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues!

From a whippoorwill out on the hill
They took a new note ( whippoorwill, whippoorwill, whippoorwill . . . )
Pushed it through a horn 'till it was worn
Into a blue note . . . ( whippoorwill, whippoorwill, whippoorwill . . . )

An' then they nursed it, and rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the ""Southland"" . . 
Gave birth to the blues!

( Shout out the wonderful news! )

Oh, the breeze from the trees
A wail from the jail
A buzz from the cousin of a nightin'gale
And ""Southland"" ( hello, hello! )

Someone to miss

To hear from each day
To be loved, to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved

Some wish for fortune and fame
But to be, truly, truly, truly loved is
More than all of these things, oh, oh

When Sunny gets blue
Her eyes get gray and cloudy
Then the rain begins to fall
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter
Love is gone so what can matter?
No sweet lover man comes to call

[Verse 2]
When Sunny gets blue
She breathes a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swayin', like some violins are playin'
Weird and haunting melodies
[Verse 3]
People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she's lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same

[Verse 4]
But memories will fade
And pretty dreams will rise up
Where her other dreams fell through
Hurry new love, hurry here
To kiss away each lonely tear
And hold her near when Sunny gets blue

To kiss away each lonely tear
And hold her near when Sunny gets blueEmbed",0.088,0.631,0.281,0.9914

At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Because I still miss someone

Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
I still miss someone

Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where

Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
The sun never shines through this window of mine
It's dark at the Home of the Blues

Memories so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die

So if you just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me misery loves company

johnny horton,joe's been a-gittin' there,1958,"Joe’s Been A-Gittin’ There LyricsThere was a Yankee Cornel in 1862
Who fell in Love with a southern belle where the sweet magnolias bloom
He wondered why folks laughed at him when he went ridin' by
But little did he know that she was a courtin' on the sly

Joe's been a gettin' there Joe's been a flyin'
Joe's been a gettin' there all this time
Joe's been a gettin' there Joe's been a flyin'
Joe's been a gettin' there beatin' his time

He walked her up the mountain he named it to her there
He offered her a band of gold and his name to share
She said that she would marry him and even set the day
But little did he know that she loved a soldier boy in grey
(Joe's been a gettin' there) Joe's been a flyin'
(Joe's been a gettin' there) all this time
(Joe's been a gettin' there) Joe's been a flyin'
(Joe's been a gettin' there) beatin' his time

She took the love he offered she took his silver too
She took every little thing from Cornel dressed in blue
She wouldn't let him hold her in a fond embrace
And when he tried to kiss his bride she laughed right in his face

Joe's been a gettin' there Joe's been a flyin'
Joe's been a gettin' there all this time
Joe's been a gettin' there Joe's been a flyin'
Joe's been a gettin' there beatin' his time

He woke up one morning and found himself alone
And all she left was a letter that said goodbye farewell I'm gone
No doubt he was a mighty man where the heroes fell
But all is fare in love and war and he lost his southern belle

(Joe's been a gettin' there) Joe's been a flyin'
(Joe's been a gettin' there) all this time
(Joe's been a gettin' there) Joe's been a flyin'

ella fitzgerald,little jazz,1958,"Two Little Men in a Flying Saucer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Two little men in a flying saucer
Flew down to Earth one day
Looked to left and right of it
Couldn’t stand the sight of it
And said ""Let’s fly away
They took a look at a Western movie
Somebody heard them say
""If a horse can be a star
Think how dumb the people are
We'd better fly away""
[Bridge]
Then they shook their little green antennas
Scratched their purple hair
Said, ""This planet is an awful menace
Let's go back to where we came from""

[Verse 2]
Two little men in a flying saucer
Just didn't care to stay (No, no)
Said, ""It's too peculiar here""
Headed for the stratosphere
And quickly flew away

[Bridge]
Now they took a left in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn
When the Dodgers played a baseball game
Heard all the screaming
Said, ""We must be dreaming 'cause this planet is insane""
During intermission, heard a politician
Making speeches as they traveled by
(Gabble, gabble, gabble)
But they departed faster than they started
'Cause the holler blew them sky high

[Verse 3]
Two little men in a flying saucer
Flew down to Earth one day
Listened to a radio, saw a television show
And said, ""Let's fly away""
They got their fill of commercial jingles
And they were heard to say
""All the people seem to be living in a nursery
We'd better fly away""
[Bridge]
Traveled all around and once they’d seen us
Said, ""Let's head for space
We were better off on Mars and Venus
Goodness, what a place to live in""

[Verse 4]
Two little men in a flying saucer
Just didn't care to stay (No, no)
Crossed a crowded thoroughfare
Saw the hats the women wear
And quickly flew away (Woo, woo)
And quickly flew away (Woo)
One look and then they flew away

In Baya California

Then I went into a dancing motion
She nodded her head

And she danced with more devotion
When her cheek came close to mine
I could hear her softly whisper

Gossiping voices made us break up, but you know we still can make up
If we forget 'em all, and answer Cupid's call

Consequently if I seem at sea

Dazes me

That I've learned to clip my wings
And soften my ways
These are ordinary things unworthy of praise
Yet he praises my
Just knowing I try for him
When so many would
If they could, die for him
I'm the one who's worldly wise

And nothing much fazes me
But to see me in his eyes
It just amazes me

The ghost riders in the sky

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

For she found someone new
How
How was I to know she'd soon go
And leave me longing in the moon glow

Since she's gone
I'm alone
I have no sweetheart
Of my own
Just a memory of a love that's grown cold
And a tarnished moon of gold

I'm alone

Played that waiting game

I wasn't wise
And now I'm by myself
With tears in my eyes

There's a land of enchantment
Just beyond my pillowcase
And I go there 'cause I know there
I'll be in your sweet embrace

The paint is peelin' right off of the wall
Good golly, the bathroom is in the hall
Woe is me, I'm lookin' for a vacancy

I could budget myself, scrimp and save to get along
But it ain't no fun givin' up wine, women and song
So I'll have a roof up above my head
But under those conditions I would rather be dead

A towels stand Señor?
Si, not a taco stand ?

They had a very good business, Señor
You see they used to dry off wetback as they came across the line
But little Rodriguez loved most of all to read comic books
That the towels always came packed in, ey, which is a pretty sneaky way of getting to the subject of this song, which is comic books not towels

Over you

When nighttime starts
Like daytime breaks
I get the blues honey and I'll tell you what it takes

For the blues
Oh yeah the blues

Well, one more time baby

One more time
And I won't have her anymore
One more kiss honey

Out of the commonplace into the rare
Somewhere in space I hang suspended

These things shall pass and some great morning
We'll look back and smile at heartaches we have known
So don't forget when shadows gather
The Lord our God is still the King upon His throne

And steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white heat
These things shall pass and life be sweeter
When love and faith are strong they cannot long endure

The darkest time is just one hour before dawn
So hold up high and face your troubles
And don't dispare if you must face them all alone

I see now that's all it meant to you
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle
So I'm all alone playing solitaire

A gamble to win or to lose
You play to win, then you find you're playing in a game with no rules
Just made for fools
Now, the Joker has a laugh on me

But I know it isn't spring
I'm as starry eyed and gravely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words I have never never heard
From a man I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing

For a gentleman to partake occasionally of ratafia
Which was ... a light-flavored liqueur of amazing potency
Which originated in Middlesex
And which we suppose is the reason for this song

Oh, Miss Bailey! Unfortunate Miss Bailey!

A captain bold in Halifax who dwelt in country quarters
Seduced a maid who hanged herself one Monday in her garters
His wicked conscience smited him; he lost his stomach daily
He took to drinking ratafia and thought upon Miss Bailey

One night betimes he went to bed for he had caught the fever Said he, ""I am a handsome man, and I'm a gay deceiver""

And Parson Biggs won't bury me though I'm a dead Miss Bailey""

They woo you with songs and a clover ring

They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And a plentiful waste of time of day

Change the shape of her frame
You can lay odds she's takin' if off

With her diamond in hock
Bet your life that the rock
Is goin' to restock some gentlemen jock

When ... you see a mouse
Hurry, scurry out of the house
And she runs twenty blocks
For cigars and rye ...

Became impatient to be free
So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shouted from the highest hill
Even told the golden daffodils

At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret anymore

Make my dreams come true
Venus if you will
Send a little girl for me to thrill
A girl who wants my kisses and my arms
A girl with all the charms of you

A lovely girl with sunlight in her hair
And take the brightest stars up in the skies
And place them in her eyes for me

Surely the things I ask can't be too great a task
Venus if you do, I promise that I always be true
I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall love

Cross over the bridge, cross over the bridge
Change your reckless way o'livin', cross over the bridge
Leave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you
Brother, cross over the bridge

If you have built a boat to take you to the greener side
And if that boat is built of ev'ry lie you ever lied
You'll never reach the Promised Land of love, I guarantee
'cause lies cannot hold water and you'll sink into the sea
Cross over the bridge, cross over the bridge
Change your reckless way o'livin', cross over the bridge
Leave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you
Brother, cross over the bridge

I know it isn't easy to resist temptation's call
But think of how your broken heart will hurt you when you fall
'cause some day you will find that you are hopelessly in love
And she'll belong to someone else as sure as stars above

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears

You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
And to fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

That Mary Hamilton's borne a babe
To the highest Stuart of all

Oh rise, arise Mary Hamilton
Arise and tell to me
What thou hast done with thy wee babe

I put him in a tiny boat
And cast him out to sea
That he might sink or he might swim
But he'd never come back to me

This night we'll go and see

Nor her robes of brown
But she put on her robes of white
To ride into Glasgow town

And as she rode into Glasgow town
The city for to see
The bailiff's wife and the provost's wife
Cried alack and alas for thee

""Oh you need not weep for me"", she cried
""You need not weep for me
For had I not slain my own wee babe
This death I would not dee""

Oh little did my mother think
When first she cradled me
The lands I was to travel in
And the death I was to dee
Last night I washed the queen's feet
Put the gold in her hair
And the only reward I find for this
The gallows to be my share

Cast off, cast off my gown, she cried
But let my petticoat be
And tie a napkin round my face
The gallows, I would not see

Then by them come the king himself
Looked up with a pitiful eye
Come down, come down Mary Hamilton
Tonight you will dine with me

Oh hold your tongue, my sovereign liege
And let your folly be

You'd never have shamed me here

What I liked about the West?
So I got together my arguments just to prove it's the best
I called the Mayor, the chief of police
And even the Governors home
To get the facts to back me up
And here's what they said on the phone
We got buffalo, deer, t-bone steaks, fruits, fish, and fowl
Wine and grapes, figs and dates, a chamber of commerce smile
Liquid sunshine, legal moonshine, Reno, Frisco, Tahoe
Man you name it and if we ain't got it
We'll get it

But the place to build morale
Is to take her for a moonlight stroll behind the old corral
Things down there are rootin' and tootin'
There's fightin', fuedin', and stuff
A prowlin' stranger could cause a shootin'
Cause enough of a thing's enough!
I met a gal at a rodeo and we took a ride that night
We saw a stack of new-mown hay
Man you can see my plight
She said let's sit
We smurred and purred and finally to top it off
I got myself a mate for life man I just couldn't help myself

But there's no season in my heart
While I play the leading part

And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And, darling, we could be happy after all

How I try to keep this fact in mind
The trees are bare the cold wind blows
And by experience we should know
Winter comes but the spring is close behind

My Papa was a hobo when they delivered me
We didn't have a doctor 'cause he couldn't pay the fee

Why the guitar's resonator was a gallon-bucket lid
But Papa played the dobro this way and he'd go

With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down

Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

When the world was writing verses like yours and mine
All the boys and girls would sing
As we sat at little tables and drank May wine
Now April, May and June seem sadly out of tune
Life has stuck a pin in the balloon

Spring is here, why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here, why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here, why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me

The ghost of Anne Boleyn walks they declare
Poor Anne Boleyn was once King Henry's wife
Until he made the headsman bob her hair
Ah, yes, he did her wrong long years ago
And she comes up at night to tell him so

She walks the bloody tower
With her head tucked underneath her arm
At the midnight hour

She comes to haunt King Henry, she means giving him what for
Gadzooks, she's going to tell him off, she's feeling very sore
And just in case the headsman wants to give her an encore
She has her head tucked underneath her arm

With her head tucked underneath her arm

And when they had a few they shout, ""Is Army going to win?""
They think it's Red Grange instead of poor old Ann Boleyn

Sometimes gay King Henry gives a spread
For all his pals and gals and ghostly crew
The headsman craves the joint and cuts the bread
Then in comes Anne Boleyn to queer the do
She holds her head up with a wild ""Wah-hoo!""
And Henry cries, ""Don't drop it in the soup!""

When the world will all be free from sin and strife

Everythin's gotta stop while you have that cigarette

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette puff puff puff and if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate that you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
3. Now at a game of chance the other night - Ol' Dame Fortune was a doin' me right
The kings and queens just kept on comin' round
And I got a full and I bettet high - But my bluff didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and layin' his money down

4. He'd raise me and I'd raise him - And I sweated blood you gotta sink or swim
He finally called and he couldn't raise the bet
I said ""aces full pal how about you"" - He said ""I'll tell you in a minute or two
But right now I just gotta have another cigarette""

5. Now the other night I had me a date - With the cutest little gal in the fifty states
One of them highbred up-town fancy little dames
She said she loved me and it seemed to me - That things were just about like they oughta be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane

6. She was oh so far from a chunk of ice - And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help me Hannah and I think I'd of been there yet
I give her a kiss and a little squeeze - And she said ""would you excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette""

Of the wheel of life

From jazz and cocktails

With distingué traces
That used to be there
You could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales
Then you came along
With your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile
That your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life
In some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest

Casts a spell over me

Get ahold of yourself!

What have I done that's made you so different and cold?
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old?

I cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body craves
But if you'll say that forever you will be mine
Think of the heartaches, the tears, and the sorrow you'll save

When you are weary and tired of another one's gold
When you are lonely, remember this letter, my own
Don't try to answer though I suffer anguish untold
If you don't love me, I wish you would leave me alone
While I am writing this letter, I think of the past
And of the promises that you are breaking so free
But soon I'll bid my farewell to this old world at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from meEmbed",0.168,0.706,0.126,-0.8978

Bonnie and Clyde were pretty-looking people
But I can tell you, people, they were the Devil's children
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil-doin'
One lazy afternoon down Savannah way
They robbed a store and high-tailed out of that town
Got clean away in a stolen car
And waited 'til the heat died down

[Verse 2]
Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation
And made the graduation into the banking business
""Reach for the sky!"" sweet-talking Clyde would holler
As Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag
Now one brave man, he tried to take them alone
They left him lying in a pool of blood
And laughed about it all the way home
[Bridge]
Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one
Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun
They used to laugh about dyin'
But deep inside them, they knew
That pretty soon they'd be lyin'
Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun and the morning dew

[Verse 3]
Acting upon reliable information
A federal deputation laid a deadly ambush
When Bonnie and Clyde came walkin' in the sunshine
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them

Send falling stars that seem to cry

There's someone new We're through We're through

Start to weep, then say goodbye

In Cherry Hill Park

Oh, Mary Hill sure was fun down at Cherry Hill Park
Playin' games with everyone 'til way after dark

And then one day, Mary Hill, she married away
A man with money said, ""Come on honey"", and she said, ""OK""
She went away to play a one-man game
And since that day it ain't been the same
'Cause Mary Hill was such a thrill after dark
Down in Cherry Hill Park

Ah, Mary Hill sure was fun down at Cherry Hill Park
Playin' games with everyone 'til way after dark

The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my lonely tears instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone

It keeps right on a-hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone

But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
You broke my heart and set me free
But you forgot your memory

The Comancheros are takin' this land

Paul Regret from New Orleans
A fast man with a gun
He didn't want to go he had to run
When he shot down the judge's son
Yes, he shot Judge Scofield's son

With the dark of night he left that town
Never to return again
With a one-way ticket at the end of the line
He was told by a stranger man
The Comancheros are takin' this land
Then the Comancheros came a-ridin' through the night
Stealin' and a-killin' takin' ever'thing in sight
Nothin' left behind but the blood and the sand
The Comancheros are takin' this land
The Comancheros are takin' this land

I'll cover every inch of the ground where I stand
I'd die before I'd run
I'm not afraid of any living man
And here I'll make my stand
With a gun I'll make my stand

He rode into the Comanchero town
Like a wild man on the run
Before he'd leave they'd all be dead
They'd die by his blazin' gun
They died by his blazin' gun

Mr. Record Man, I'm lookin' for a song I heard today
There was someone blue singing 'bout someone who went away
Just like me, his heart was yearnin' for a love that used to be

And he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night

And the man that I heard singin' sounded so blue and all alone
As I listened to his lonely song, I wondered, ""Could it be?
Could there somewhere be another lonely man like me?""

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
He kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

And be better off than you are, doo doo

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar

He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night, when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries o'er my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail

Listen to me, Lil'

Never overplay your hand

He'll be hangin' ’round warming up to you

Except for one disappointment one fly in the ointment

But the aggravation of my situation
I might as well get it off my chest
It's the drab appellation
Oh pardon the big words I apply
But I was an english major at c.c.n.y

With which I am persistently addressed
Persistently, perpetually, continually and inevitably addressed!
Believe me, it could drive a person positively psychosomatic

Ain't so objectable
It's kind of crummy but chummy
Of course if I got married, that would do it

With some she traveled fast, with others it was slow
Betsy's seen them all, she'd seen them come and go
She must have had some favorites before I finally met her
And now that she's all mine, they'd better just forget her
Betsy was a lady and that she will remain

bob dylan,the death of emmett till,1963,"The Death of Emmett Till (Witmark Demo - 1962) Lyrics[Verse 1]
T'was down in Mississippi, not so long ago
When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door
This boy's dreadful tragedy I can still remember well
The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till

[Verse 2]
Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up
They said they had a reason, but I can't remember what
They tortured him and did some things, too evil to repeat
There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street
[Verse 3]
Then they rolled his body down a gulf, amidst a bloody red rain
And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain
The reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it ain't no lie
Was just for the fun of killing him and to watch him slowly die

[Verse 4]
And then to stop, the United States of yelling for a trial
Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till
But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime
And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody there seemed to mind

[Verse 5]
I saw the morning papers but I could not bear, to see
The smiling brothers walking' down the courthouse stairs
For the jury found them innocent, and the brothers they went free
While Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea

[Verse 6]
If you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that's so unjust
Your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is filled with dust
Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow
For you to let this human race fall down so God-awful low!

Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

I was their only son
My mind got mixed with rambling
When I was all so young
And I left my home the first time
When I was twelve and one

An’ I’ll be a long time gone

On the western side of Texas
On the Texas plains
I tried to find a job o’ work
But they said l’s young of age
My eyes they burned when I heard
“Go home where you belong!”
I’m a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

I remember when I’s rambling
Around with the carnival trains
Different towns, different people
Somehow they’re all the same
I remember children’s faces best
I remember traveling on
I’m a long time a-comin’
I’ll be a long time gone

[Verse 4]
I once loved a fair young maid
An’ I ain’t too big to tell
If she broke my heart a single time
She broke it ten or twelve
I walked and talked all by myself
I did not tell no one
I’m a long time a-comin’, babe
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

[Verse 5]
Many times by the highwayside
I tried to flag a ride
With bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth
I’d watch the cars roll by
The empty air hung in my head
I’s thinkin’ all day long

I’ll be a long time gone

You might see me on your crossroads
When I’m a-passin’ through
Remember me how you wished to
As I’m a-Driftin’ from your view
I ain’t got the time to think about it
I got too much to get done
Well, I’m a long time coming
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

If I can’t help somebody
With a word or song
If I can’t show somebody

Jimmy, I just came back from a lovely trip along the milky way
I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old, dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me
Now Santa is a busy man, he has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Because he's getting ready, his reindeers and his sleigh

[Chorus]
You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list, he's checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 1]
He sees when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
Oh, you'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too -

Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town
[Verse 2]
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

When first I came to Louisville, my fortune there to find
I met a fair young maiden there, her beauty filled my mind
Her rosy cheek, her ruby lips, they gave my heart no rest
The name she bore was Flora, the lily of the west

[Verse 2]
I courted lovely Flora, she promised ne'er to go
But soon a tale was told to me that filled my heart with woe
They said she meets another man who holds my love in jest
And yet I trusted Flora, the lily of the west
[Verse 3]
Way down in yonder shady grove, a man of low degree
He spoke unto my Flora there and kissed her 'neath a tree
The answers that she gave to him like arrows pierced my breast
I was betrayed by Flora, the lily of the west

[Verse 4]
I stepped up to my rival, my dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar and I ordered him to stand
All in my desperation I stabbed him in his breast
I'd killed a man for Flora, the lily of the west

[Verse 5]
And then I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea
They placed me in a prisoner's dock and then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora, the lily of the west (Lily of the west)Embed",0.12,0.737,0.144,0.743

The better off I'll be

In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a Winter Wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is the new bird
He's singing our song, as we go along
Walking in a Winter Wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"", We'll say ""No man
But you can do the job when you're in town.""
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a Winter Wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr.Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'

The bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits
I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles
The music play slow
But farewell Angelina
The night is on fire
And I must go

There is no use in talking
And there's no need for blame
There is nothing to prove
Ev’rything still is the same
A table stands empty
By the edge of the stream
But farewell Angelina
The sky's changing colours
And I must leave

The jacks and the queens
They forsake the courtyard
Fifty-two gypsies
Now file past the guards
In the space where the deuce
And the ace once ran wild
Farewell Angelina
The sky is folding
I'll see you after a while

[Verse 4]
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting
Perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans
With a sawed-off shotgun
And the corporals and neighbors
Clap and cheer with each blast
Farewell Angelina
The sky it is trembling
And I must leave fast

King Kong, little elves
In the rooftoops they dance
Valentino-type tangos
While the hero's clean hands
Shut the eyes of the dead
Not to embarrass anyone
Farewell Angelina
The sky is flooding over
And I must be gone

The camouflaged parrot
He flutters from fear
When something he doesn't know about
Suddenly appears
What cannot be imitated
Perfect must die
Farewell Angelina
The sky's flooding over
And I must go where it is dry

Puppets heave rocks
At misunderstood visions
And at the faces of clocks

Till we land again Australia far away
Far from friends and San Francisco and the Miss I thought I miss so
Till I stepped ashore of Melbourne that first day

But I met Melba from Melbourne she made my heart yearn
She made my tears flow like wine
She let me kiss her then made me miss her
Cause Melba could never be mine
So in love but couldn't get her cared so much I couldn't forget her

I was standin' there and tryin' so hard to keep from cryin'
And the more I tried the more my tears would show
Then the south breeze seem to whisper
Hold her close and once more kiss her
It was hopeless so I turned away to go

george jones,in the shadow of a lie,1963,"In The Shadow Of A Lie LyricsI lead a rich rewarding life, a wife, a home, a car
But generally you can find me down in some dim lit bar
I hold all the pleasures of the world, this fact I can't deny
But I'm living, yes, I'm living in the shadow of a lie
My wife's first husband and myself were on a fishin' trip
He was in our rowboat, me on shore, when I saw my partner slip
A hellish thing took hold of me and I delayed my rescue dash
Still I knew my lover husband had finally breathed his last
I took his body back to town and restrained a happy smile
When they said there'd be a hearin', wouldn't even be a trial
That a fine upstanding citizen like me could do no wrong
And the walls between me and my love would finally soon be gone
Now just when my world glows brightest and warm thoughts run through my head
A chilling darkness hovers like a demon over head
And sometimes the guilt inside me reigns so strong I hope to die
For I'm living, is it living, in the shadow of a lie...Embed",0.075,0.667,0.258,0.9944

All left is the dead and the dying, the blue lying long side the grave
So you think the battle is over, and you even lay down your gun
You carelessly rise from your cover, for you think the battle is done

Get flat on the ground here beside me, and lay your heart to the sand
Can you hear the deafening rumble, can you feel the trembling ground
It's not just the horses and wagons that make such a deafening sound
For every shot fired had an echo and every man killed wanted life
There lies your friend Jim McKinney, can you take the news to his wife?
No son the battle's not over, the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover the part that has blackened the sun
The fight yet to come is not with cannon, nor will the fight be hand-to-hand
No one will regroup the forces, no charge will a general command
The battle will rage in the bosom of mother and sweetheart and wife
Brother and sister and daughter will grieve for the rest of their lives
Now go ahead, rise from your cover, be thankful that God let you live
Go fight the rest of the battle for those who gave all they could give
I see sir the battle's not over, the battle has only begun

I know I'll reach the shoreline though at times the lights are dim
He'll take me past the rocky cliffs from life's storm I'll be released
With his hand on my shoulder I'll have everlasting peace

Surrounded by an angry sea that's made of hate and sin
But I won't sink as long as I won't let the waters in
And with the help of God I know I'll never lose my way
With his hand on my shoulder I cannot go astray
I have a home up in the sky and he made it just for me
But to prove that I'll desert this home I have to sail this sea
The waves of sin sometimes are high and the spray might touch my clothes
With his hand on my shoulder it will never touch my soulEmbed",0.108,0.71,0.182,0.9408

johnny cash,here was a man,1963,"Here Was a Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
(Joy to the world, the Lord is come)
Here was a man, a man
Who was born in a small village
The son of a peasant woman
He grew up in another small village
Until he reached the age of thirty
He worked as a carpenter

[Verse 2]
Then for three years
He was a traveling minister
But he never traveled more
Than two hundred miles from
Where he was born and
Where he did go he usually walked
[Verse 4]
He never held political office
He never wrote a book
Never bought a home
Never had a family
He never went to college
And he never set foot inside a big city

Yes, here was a man

[Verse 5]
Though he never did one on the things
Usually associated with greatness
He had no credentials but himself
He had nothing to do with this world
Except through the divine purpose
That brought him to this world

[Verse 6]
While he was still a young man
The tide of popular opinion turned against him
Most of his friends ran away
One of them denied him
One of them betrayed him
And turned him over to his enemies
Then he went through the mockery of a trial
[Verse 7]
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves
And even while he was dying
His executioners gambled
For the only piece of property
That he had in this world
And that was his robe his purple robe

[Verse 8]
When he was dead
He was taken down from the cross
And laid in a borrowed grave
Provided by compassionate friends
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone
And today he's a centerpiece of the human race
Our leader in the column to human destiny

[Verse 9]
I think, I'm well within the mark when I say
That all of the armies that ever marched
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas
All of the legislative bodies that ever sat
And all of the kings that ever reigned
All of them put together have not affected
The life of man on this earth
So powerfully as that one solitary life

Of a memory that's haunting me

In some quiet nook
I go through its pages
And peruse this ageless tale
Of the love that failed
To ever become true
On this page is the date
Of that fateful night at eight
When we found we were no longer in love
After that there's nothing more
Just a dark and futile door
That shuts out the stars above

I inscribed your heart vows
But since we're apart

To touch your hand
To kiss you

To count to ten

You'd drive me crazy if I let you

Remind me I'm in love again

I get my heart, well in hand, and I'm certain
That I can take you, or leave you alone
Then you begin that beguine again
And boom, I give in , again
I have a will made of steel, my friend
But when it seems about to bend

Remind me
Not to mention that I love you
Remind me
To be sorry that we met

Although I adore you
Remind me to ignore you

They lingered like two poor waifs outside
For well she knew 'twas only safe outside

I only wish that I was made of ice""

But not behind a bolted door with him

She didn't say yes
She didn't say no
For heaven was near
She wanted it so

Above her sweet love was beckoning
And yet she knew there'd be a reckoning

She wanted to climb
But dreaded to fall
So bided her time
And clung to the wall

She wanted to act ad libitum
But feared to lose her equilibrium

With distingué traces

By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales
Then you came along
With your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile
That your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
I guess (Ah, yes,) I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris might (will) ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Stifling those who strive

In some small dive
And there I'll be

In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips so warm and tender

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender

The fragrance drifts across the garden
Like the scent of some forgotten melody
This melody, belongs to you, belongs to me, belongs to no one

See the way the crimson petals scatter when the wind blows

Ah! The secret sigh of love that suddenly the heart knows
See now a robin's there among the puddless
And, hopping through the misty rain drops
He's come to tell us it is spring

Look at the double rainbow
The rain is silver in the sun light
A fleeting fox is in the garden
Rain sweet lovin'mother rain

That swells the streams
That cleans the sky

At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I'd become my enemy

My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow

Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking

bob dylan,only a pawn in their game,1964,"Only a Pawn in Their Game Lyrics[Verse 1]
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood
A finger fired the trigger to his name
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man’s brain
But he can’t be blamed
He’s only a pawn in their game

[Verse 2]
A South politician preaches to the poor white man
“You got more than the blacks, don’t complain
You’re better than them, you been born with white skin,” they explain
And the Negro’s name
Is used it is plain
For the politician’s gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game
[Verse 3]
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
And the marshals and cops get the same
But the poor white man’s used in the hands of them all like a tool
He’s taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he’s in
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game

[Verse 4]
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the hoof beats pound in his brain
And he’s taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back, with his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide 'neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He ain't a-got no name
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game
[Verse 5]
Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
They lowered him down as a king
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun
He’ll see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain
Only a pawn in their game4Embed",0.147,0.765,0.088,-0.9818

William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gatherin'
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
[Verse 2]
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was a-snarling
And in a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

[Verse 3]
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn’t even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothin' to William Zanzinger
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
[Verse 4]
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears

I've hoed in the cornfield I've picked in the cotton yes I've lived a lot in my time

And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright

But if you love him
You'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him
Oh, be proud of him

Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man

I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside
Like my heart's sprung a big leak
And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
That I may never shake
Now you might say that I was taking it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawll

[Chorus]
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the back stretch
Heartache's a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on, and it looks like heartache's
And the winner loses all
[Verse 2]
One day I had ventured in love, never once suspecting
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning
And finding that you'd gone from me
There's aching and pain in my heart
For the day was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place

[Chorus]
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the back stretch
Heartache's a-going to the inside

They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running

Hoof prints and foot prints, deep ruts the wagons made
The victor and the loser came by here
No head stones, but these bones bring the mascalero death moans
See the smooth black nuggets by the thousands lying here
Petrified, but justified are these apache tears
Dead grass, dry roots, hunger crying in the night
Ghost of broken hearts and laws are here
And who saw the young squaw, they judged by their whiskey law
Tortured till she died of pain and fear
Where the soldiers lay her back, are the black apache tears
The young men, the old men, the guilty and the innocent
Bled red blood and chilled alike with fears
The red men, the white men, no fight ever took this land
So don't raise the dust when you pass here
They're sleeping and in my keeping are these apache tears1Embed",0.341,0.586,0.073,-0.9954

And we'd live life the way the rich folks do

Together me and you

And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell
In this crummy Southern town
In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'
No, you couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you'll wonder who could that have been
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""What's she got to grin?""
I'll tell you
There's a ship
The Black Freighter
With a skull on its masthead
Will be coming in

You gentlemen can say: ""Hey gal, finish them floors!
Get upstairs! What's wrong with you! Earn your keep here!""
You toss me your tips
And look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads
As I'm making the beds
Cuz there's nobody gonna sleep here
Tonight, nobodys gonna sleep here, honey
Nobody
Nobody!

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you say: ""Who's that kicking up a row?""
And ya see me kinda starin' out the winda
And you say: ""What's she got to stare at now?""
I'll tell ya

There's a ship
The Black Freighter
Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow
Now, you gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell: ""Why do they spare that one?""
Yes, that's what you say: ""Why do they spare that one?""

All the night through, through the noise and to-do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship
The Black Freighter
Runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me
""Kill them NOW, or LATER?""
Askin' ME!
""Kill them now, or later?""
Noon by the clock
And so still at the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, ""Right now
Right now!""

Then they pile up the bodies
And I'll say
""That'll learn ya!""

No matter where I go
The clouds are all the same
To them I'm just
A pebble in the Sand, a face without a name

Nobody gives a hang for what I say or do
But you
And in the shelter of your arms
I find peace and comfort and care
For I am wanted there
In this cold world
I struggle to survive
And sometimes I would fall

You'll think someone
Would lend a helping hand they'd sooner to see me crawl

Now just when life itself seems more than I can bare, your there
And in the shelter of your arms
I find strength and safety in them
I rise and start again

Just give me one good reason
To go on living
To keep on trying
For what
I ask you for what
If not for you and all your love
To see me through

When times look bad
The shelter of your arms will keep away each fear
And this cold world
Can never get me down
As long as you are here
That's why I pray to god
You'll never say goodbye
And I will know the shelter of your arms
And your love for all of my life

I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune that
She whistles night and noon
Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again-
And yet
I've grown accustomed to her look
Accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face
""Marry Freddy.""
What an infantile idea
What a heartless, wicked, brainless thing to do
But she'll regret, she'll regret it
It's doomed before they even take the vow!

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill
In a wretched little flat above a store
I can see her now, not a penny in the till
And a bill collector beating at the door
She'll try to teach the things I taught her
And end up selling flowers instead

Begging for her bread and water
While her husband has his breakfast in bed
In a year, or so, when she's prematurely grey
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk
She'll come home, and lo, he'll have upped and run away
With a social-climbing heiress from New York

Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!
How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But I'm a most forgiving man
The sort who never could, ever would
Take a position and staunchly never budge
A most forgiving man
But, I shall never take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees
Let her promise to atone
Let her shiver, let her moan
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

""Marry Freddy""-h a!

But I'm so used to hear her say
""Good morning"" ev'ry day
Her joys, her woes
Her highs, her lows
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I'm very grateful she's a woman
And so easy to forget
Rather like a habit
One can always break
And yet

Of something in the air

Impaled on my wall

To the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath

And the pattern never alters

And I gave it to the river deep

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing

Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
Suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When my life is ended, my time has run out

Shut the eyes of the dead

Two cried out for mercy, the third man looked at me
And oh the hurt in this man's eyes just broke my heart in two
It seemed that I could hear him say, ""I'm doing this for you""
I knelt beneath the third man's cross and slowly bowed my head
I reached out to touch his feet and stained my hands with red
And when I heard him cry in pain, I raised my eyes to see
The blood spilled from the third man's side and some of it spilled on me
The third man wore a crown of thorns, spikes held him to the tree
I heard him say, ""Oh God, my God, hast thou forsaken me?""
And there within the mighty crowd, the ones who mocked him cried
""King, save thyself if thy art King"" and then the third man died
Suddenly, I heard the thunder roll, saw lightning pierce the sky
The third man was still hanging there and I began to cry
I saw the boulders fall and heard the breaking of the ground

My eyes were wet where I had cried

And in a few short years drift so far apart

The way you wanted him to do
And changed your name from Brown to Jones

To hide the mortal sin
Of shooting down another man
Who has no chance to win

They'll never see it again
That smiling mask that watched them die

[Chorus]
The Devil's grin
The Devil's grin
I've worn a star a long long time
Though it's not so long in years
When you use a gun you count the time and hours
In blood and fears

My reputation says I'm fast
The fastest gun around
And that's why those who break the law
Don't hang around my town

But looking down and straight at me
Like a statue carved of stone
Was the smiling face of an evil man
Like none I'd ever known

He touched his hat politely
Bid the time of day to me
But all the time deep in his eyes
I saw taunting me

[Chorus]
The Devil's grin

The hackles on my neck stood up
For in his eyes I saw
That he neither lacked the courage
Nor the willingness to draw
It wasn't like the times before
I'd played this deadly game
With some fast reputation
Or an outlaw with a name

This man just hung around the town
I watched, he did no wrong
Inside I knew he'd come for me
But when, where, how long?

He was clever, he asked questions
Where there a ranch to buy?
He made the people like him
With a smile that meant I'd die

[Chorus]
The Devil's grin

I knew I had to force his hand
There was no need to pretend
I trapped him in a game of cards
There could only be one end

I called him cheat and shot him down
Knowing that I would win
And my face in the mirror
Behind the bar, was wearing
The Devil's grin

Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for

So strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall

I'm going to be the first

I'd hate to see you fall
Because there is no doubt they'll carry you out

But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died

I discovered the Valley of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
While prospecting in a western state
I saw the silent windmills, the crumbling water tanks
The bones of the cattle picked clean by buzzards
Bleached by the desert sun
I stumbled over a crumbling buck board
Nearly covered by the sand
And stopping to rest I heard a tinkling, whispering sound
And suddenly realized that even though the wind was quiet
The sand did not lie still
I seemed to be surrounded be a mystery
So heavy and apperceive I could scarcely breath
For weeks I wondered aimlessly in the valley
Seeking answers to the many questions that raced through my mind
Where was everyone? Why the white bones? The dry wells?
The barren valley where people must have lived and died
I sat down and buried my face in my hands
And resting I learned the secret of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
How I managed to escape from the valley I don't know
But now to pay my debt for being saved
I must tell you what I learned out on the desert
So many years ago
When the day is oddly quiet
And the breeze seems not to blow
One would think the sun is resting
But you'll find this is not so
It is whispering softly whispering
As it slowly moves along
And for those who stop and listen
It will sing this mournful song
Of sidewinders and the horn toads
On the thorny chaparral
In the sunny days and moonlight lights
The lonely coyotes yell
How the stars seem they can touch you
As you lay and gaze on high
At the heavens where your hoping
You'll be going when you die1Embed",0.068,0.871,0.061,-0.327

johnny cash,a letter from home,1965,"A Letter From Home Lyrics[Verse]
A cowpoke rode in one hot dusty day to a store down in old San Antone
He stood at the window and I heard him say do I have a letter from home
The postmaster looked through the mail that had come
Then smilingly shook his grey head
The cowboke looked sadly a moment at him and these are the words that he said
No letter from home no letter from home there's never a letter from home
(No message from mother and none from the other) there's never a letter from home
That night he was shot on the wrong side of town no more of those plains will he roam
I reached for my Bible and gave it to him and said son here's your letter from home
If only I had just a little more time to read it the young cowpoke said
I can't take it with me and I must go on then he died with his letter unread
[Outro]

Yes springtime is sad and it troubles my mind
In a world full of women, not one girl is mine

johnny cash,stampede,1965,"Stampede Lyrics[Verse]
We made camp along Red River
Watched the cattle as they bedded down
Back at the wagons, right after supper
We spread our bedrolls on the ground
And me and Willie, we took the night guard
And the sage never smelled so sweet
The prairie moon, was blazing silver
No chance tonight for a stampede
Way over yonder, off in the distance
Towards the mountains there in the west
Did I see lightning, did I hear thunder
My mind is weary, I could use some rest
Then all at once, the wind shifts directions
The clouds roll in behind the tumbleweeds
These longhorn cattle, are getting restless
God help us all, if they stampede
Smell the rain, hear the thunder
The midnight sky, turns black as death
The lightning crashes, smell the sulphur
It's rank and strong, it's Satan's breath
The cattle rise up, and go to running
I spur my pony on and take the lead
And across the herd, I can hear Willie yelling
Hey Stampede!
Dust clouds rise, as the rain falls
They mix together, turn the air to mud
I feel the longhorns brush against me
And I can feel the demons racing through my blood
Then all at once, my pony stumbles
We hit the ground, I rise up to my knees
In a flash of light, I can see the cattle coming
Lord I know I'm going to die in this stampede
Then I awake, and I look around me
I'm in my bedroll and I'm laying on the ground
Over there's the wagon, and there's the campfire
I was only dreaming, but what's that sound?
Then I feel the earth tremble underneath me
As the midnight sky begins to bleed
And from the blackness I can hear Willie yelling
Hey StampedeEmbed",0.069,0.905,0.025,-0.8698

Let me tell you ’bout a shiz-al, the triz I was a punk ho

She was a priz-ick of a use-ick, a-just to you, my diz-it
Whatever, you know what I'm sayin'
She lick you in the iz-ip
This punk ho can't hold a conversation
'Cause she's always concentratin' lookin' at Kilo dick
Tell that bitch to lick (Why, Kilo?)
Because she’s a punk ho (Punk ho, punk ho)
So what you sayin’, punk ho?

Now this punk ho was sneaky, she told a nigga ""lead me""
Hick-it with some money, she'll give him sucky-sucky
But Mimi wasn’t wit it, he told her to forget it
And when he told that punk ho that you know she didn't-didn't
So don't ever trust this punk ho, don’t let her bite your bubble
'Cause if she makes it sizzle, you're gonna need some cocoa

She was dancin' like a friz-eak in the middle of the floor
I was standing on all a wiz-oz, she came and grab my biz-alls
She grabbed me by my hips
And then she led me down the hiz-all
She said ""You like my titties? Nigga, you can have them
I know your name is Kilo, and I really like your album""
We stepped into the riz-oom, I said ""Can we be friends?""
I laid her on the bed and I started gettin' in
I looked up to the sky, and then I yelled ""Bet!""
Between her little legs it was drippin' sticky wet
Before I left, she stopped and gave me biz-o

Her pussy was so good I put it in a frame
She asked me what I do, I told her that that I sang
Can't eat, can't sleep, just geek-geek-geek-geek (Cocaine)
I was down, fat in the pocket
She said ""I'll let you hit me, but you got to give a profit""
I stepped back on the bitch, and this is what I asked her
""Ho, what you take me for? A fuckin' pay mount?""

She couldn't tell a ho because she knew that he would had
She had real long hair, fucked her on the stair
Whispered in her ear ""You're havin' an affair""
She said ""This is a secret, Kilo won't tell""
I sent her husband her panties in the mother fuckin' mail
She took the bitch to court, and left her alone
She wanted to bone, but her nigga is gone

Well my name is Kilo G, I met this girl named Tammy
Fucked her from Atlanta all the way back to miami
Got her in my car and we fired up a jiz-oint
Fuck the small talk, I went straight to the piz-oint
Said ""You like freakin'"", said ""You might as well""
I took the stupid bitch to the nearest motel
I got her in the room and we started gettin' serious
I couldn't fuck her 'cause this bitch is on her period
She jumped up, I DDT'd her on the floor

Leave a shredded body in the basement of a gym

If you a liquid, you'd be nothin' but snot

The country I come from is a part of the Free West
I was taught and brought up there its laws to abide
And that the land that I live in has God on its side

Oh the history books tell it, they tell it so well
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell
The cavalries charged, the Indians died
For the country was young with God on its side

Oh the first World War, it came and it went
The reason for fighting I never could get
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side
And then the second World War, it came to an end
We forgave the Germans and now we are friends
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried

The Germans now, too, have God on their side

But now we have weapons of chemical dust
And if fire them we're forced to, why then fire them we must
One push of the button and a shot the worldwide
And you never ask questions when God's on your side

'tho many a long hour I've thought on this
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you, you will have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side

And now as I leave you, I'm weary as hell

And tell your heart life must go on
You've got to learn to leave the table
When love's no longer being served
To show everybody that you're able
To leave without saying a word

You've got to learn to hide your sorrow
And go on living as before
What good is thinking of tomorrow
Who knows what it may have in store

Your winning ways excited me
And all the while I was certain
That we two found a love that comes just to a few

Though I know that evening's empire
Has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand
But still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me
I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's
Too dead for dreaming

Magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped
My hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering

I'm ready to go anywhere
I am ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

Madly through the sun
It's not aimed at anyone
It's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky, there are no fences facing

And if you hear vague traces
Of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a ragged clown behind
And if to you he looks blind
I wouldn't worry, it's just a shadow that you are seeing that he's chasing

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me

Then take me disappearing
Through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time
Far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, sheltered trees
Out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
Driving memory and fate
Deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Oh, I've cried and I've cried these are tears that I can't hide

And I watch while the sun fades away
And the lonliness there brings me grief and dispair

With speed and new invention

With Mr. Einstein's theory
So we must get down to earth at times
Relax, relieve the tension

Or what may yet be proved
The simple facts of life are such
They cannot be removed

A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you,""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs, never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That, no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

A woman's a two-face, a worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night

And so I must go
Where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me
And no one beside me

I'll go on my way
And after the day
The dark-ness will hide me
Any maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter
With you I could learn to
With you on a new day

jimmy durante,as time goes by,1965,"As Time Goes By LyricsYou must remember this
A kiss is just a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say ""I love you,""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman need man, and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

My mother on cold sand

Never said a word
As if she were dumb
A woman who will talk too much
Is soon to lose her man
They say God made man first
And made a woman second choice
And so that’s why woman should
Obey her master’s voice
When the man is hungry
She bakes the bread
When man is cold
She warms up the bed
Standing up or laying down
The woman has to work

They say poor man wakes early
And he works until it’s night
The rich man wakes up late
And tells the poor man what is right
So the poor prays to shango up above
So the rich will lose the money they love

When the great shells roar and pound
And never they fear when the foe is near
To lay their orders down
But off with your hats and three times three
For every sailor's son
For the men below who fight the foe
The men behind the guns
Oh, the men behind the guns

Their hearts a-pounding heavy
When they swing to port once more
With never enough of the greenback stuff
They start for the leave ashore
And you'd think perhaps the blue-blouse chaps
Had better clothes to wear
For the uniforms of officers
Could hardly be compared
Warriors bold with straps of gold
That dazzle like the sun
Outshine the common sailor boys
The lads who serve the guns
Oh, the men behind the guns

But say not a word 'til the shot is heard
That tells the fight is on
And the angry sound of another round
Says there must be God
Over the deep and the deadly sweep
Of the fire and the bursting shell
Where the very air is a mad despair
The throes of a living hell
But down and deep in a mighty ship
Unseen by the midday sun
Oh, you'll find the boys who make the noise
The lads who serve the guns
Oh, the men behind the guns

And well they know the cyclone blow
Loose from the cannon's steel
And they know the hull of the enemy ship
Will quiver with the feel
And the decks will rock with the lightning shock
And shake with a great recoil
While the sea grows red with the blood of the dead
And swallows up her spoil
But not until the final ship
Has made her final run
Can we give the rest to the very best

In searching questions
Cannot catch the shadow

And unmentioned
Through the death
Of a saltless sea
No one knows me
In the morning
No one sees me go walking by
And if I listen while no one answers
The winds can only echo a goodbye

While through your windows
And through your walls
I see you made of crystal light
I see you running and never moving
I see you waiting for my knife

But I'm sure there's an explanation
Maybe it's the way you carry yourself
Or maybe it's your conversation
You got me tiptoeing on a cloud
I pray that I might fall through
And hit rock bottom, soon to be forgotten
Like so many other people do

I need you to help me convince myself (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
That besides me there's no-one else (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
'Cause I feel a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you

The guys I used to hang around with
Tell me that I've changed, that I'm acting kinda strange
But they don't realise that since I met you
My whole life has been rearranged
You make me feel kinda insecure
'Cause my heart, I can no longer control
And you've got me knocking, jumping and stopping
Don't know which way I'm supposed to go

My heart is all tied up in knots (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
I walk around daily in a state of shock (oh-oh-oh, I love you)

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowin' if I'm comin' or goin'
But I, I love you, this old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes I do
These old arms of mine miss havin' you around
Makes these tears inside start fallin' down
Always with half a kiss you remind me of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start feelin' cause my head starts spinnin'

Cause I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do

Ooo, I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're here for a day, gone for the week now

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
I'll tell the world about it

Cause I, I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do
I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you

I come and stand at every door
But no one hears my silent prayer
I knock and yet remain unseen
For I am dead, for I am dead
I'm only seven although I died
In Hiroshima long ago
I'm seven now as I was then
When children die they do not grow
My hair was scorched by swirling fire
My eyes grew dim, my eyes grew blind
Death came and turned my bones to dust
And that was scattered by the wind
I need no fruit, I need no rice
I need no sweets nor even bread
I ask for nothing for myself
For I am dead, for I am dead
All that I ask is that for peace
You fight today, you fight today
So that the children of this world
May live and grow and laugh and playEmbed",0.315,0.638,0.047,-0.9958

Building castles in the sky
See all the animals go round
And hear music coming
From a merry-go-round

tim buckley,strange street affair under blue,1966,"Strange Street Affair Under Blue LyricsJust for you with your open hands
Waiting for the touch of man
Clutching with your blackened gloves
You try to capture all the doves
That flee into
The forest before you

You wish to catch and cage me now
I wonder if you remember how
Hard it was to say the names
Of mirror dreams and cheated games
And on the wall
You framed your first lover
Your form intrigues me with the glow
I'll remember you I know
Though I forgot to lock the chain
Around you with a prayer for rain
To bring the call
To drive you back into my bed

Ahhh....
She turns away
Telling me to follow for a while
Ahhh....
She waits

You'd be touched if you would touch
But you only reach and taunt
Will my taste stay grey and blue
If I try to turn from youEmbed",0.03,0.906,0.064,0.5023

Just be quiet and feel it around you
And I opened my heart to the whole universe
And I found it was loving
And I saw the great blunder my teacher's had made

donovan,legend of a girl child linda,1966,"Legend of a Girl Child Linda LyricsI will bring you gold apples
And grapes made of rubies
That have shone in the eyes of
A prince of the breeze

Bright cascading crystals
They danced in the sand dunes
On the beach of no footprints
To harpsichord tunes

A throne of white ivory
A gown of white lace
Lies still in the magic
Of a timeless place
One hundred small children
They laugh at the white doves
That rest on their hands
With the touch of love

On a hillside of velvet
The children they lay down
And make fun of the grown-ups
With their silly frown

And the sound of their laughter
Is the sound of the green sea
As it washed around the foot of
The seashell tree

The doves circled over
And land in the trees
Where parrots are talking
Their words with such ease

Thus spoke three wizards
To the young ones that day:
“There’s sadness in the kingdom
Make it go far away

If you follow the sunbeams
Through the valley of flowers
To the palace of the White Queen
With its white jade towers.”
The youngest, she sighed and
The clouds drew away
And a hundred small fingers
Scratched their heads in dismay

From out of the sun a
Giant gull came flying
And the children got ready
To sit on its wing

They waved to the raindrops
As they soared o'er the trees
The wind tossed their hair high
Flashing gold on the sea

They came to the castle
And there they did fall
And they saw all the sadness
Through the crystal wall

A princess lay a-sleeping
So gentle and kind
Whilst her prince took to battle
With his confused mind

The clash of bright metal
Brought the children fear
But their cloaks of blue satin
Dried up all of his tears
Thus children held hands and
They spelled out her name
All the golden children
Became a golden chain

It lies on a white throne
In a magic place
With a tunic of velvet
And a gown of white lace

My sword, it lies broken
And cast in a lake
In the dream I was told that
My princess would wakeEmbed",0.07,0.868,0.062,-0.6184

And you can bet your bottom dollar she'll come a lookin' for me
When she finds that I'm not there
And if she catches her sweet thang a running around
I know there'll be the devil to pay
She'll come blowin' like a cyclone through that door
And I can hear exactly what she'll say
Well, has anybody here see my sweet thang
I got a notion he'll be headin' this way
'Cause when my sweet thang's out tom cattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play
I wanna tell all you barroom roses
That if my sweet thang does happen by
You'd better take my advice if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have something in your eye

Well, I gave my baby money on payday
Except a little she don't know that I've got
'Cause there's a cute little waitress down at the corner cafe
And she seems to like me quite a lot
Well, we were sittin' in this back booth a havin' a talk
And she's believen every word that I said
When the door blew open and mama walked in
Yellin' loud enough to wake the dead
Well, has anybody here see my sweet thang
I got a notion he'll be headin' this way

And the Way the truth aligned
And the Way has never changed
Since He spoke the word that night

In this world of wild confusion
We are often led astray
When we hear the word old-fashioned

He's more timeless than the seas
And His words still hold the power
As they did at Galilee

Some are prone to take the Bible
And dilute the words of Christ
They admit He came here one time
But will never make it twice

Be not temped by those prophets
He said such men would arise
There is darkness in their teaching
But there's light through Jesus Christ

Can't you see the damage you have done?
You have driven him away forever

And I know he loved me from the start
Now he hates the sight of all I stand for
All because of you, oh, jealous heart

When I knew the end would bring me pain
Now he's gone, he's gone and found another
Oh, I'll never see my love again

lorne greene,i'm a gun,1966,"I’m A Gun LyricsI was born in the blast of a furnace of steel
And I wondered what shape I would be
I was hard, I was cold, I was just a day old
And I wondered what future I'd see
Then a rough pair of hands fashioned pieces of steel
And a handle of smooth silky wood
And an arm held me out
While the eye of the man kept staring as hard as he could

I was fitted with bullets, with jackets of steel
And then taken outside in the light
Then he aimed me direct at a man on a horse
And his hands squeezed me tighter than tight
A bursting of fire exploded inside me sent flying a comet of heat
As the smoke cleared the way
I could see straight ahead the man who layed dead in the street
I'm a gun, I'm a gun
Til the day that man destroys me, I'm a gun
It's not the gun that kills a man
It's the man who fires the gun that kills a man
It's not the gun that kills a man

I tried to call out but my steel has no tongue
And to men, I am only a slave
I've never forgotten that terrible day
And that man that I couldn't save
No one knows what it means to be held in a hand
To be pointed and triggered to kill
To be labeled a gun with no power to stop
All the blood that man shooting will spill

It's a pity a man cannot live to the age of a mountain, the desert, or the sea
Only then would he learn
That to kill or be killed
Wasn't something that needed to be
Maybe someday, somehow when all men will meet
They will bury their guns in the ground
I hope they bury me, deep, so deep that I'll never be found

I'm a gun, I'm a gun
Til the day that man destroys me, I'm a gun

And eyes that stare in defeat
Or souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts
Where a living death is all that's left for men with broken hearts

You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be when they come passing by
For it's written that the greatest men never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts

You've never walked in that man's shoes
Or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands
While the heart inside you dies
Some were paupers some were kings
And some were masters of the arts
But in their shame they're all the same
These men with broken hearts

Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath

As they gently walk across a lonely floor
And the voice is softly saying
Darling, this will be goodbye for evermore!
There goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything!
As my memory turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of the door!
There goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession

And take his sweet Cindy to see New Orleans
One day a riverboat gambler chanced by
And captured her heart with his sweet words and lies

the yardbirds,ever since the world began,1966,"Ever Since the World Began LyricsEver since the world began
Satan's followed every man
Trapping evil if he can
I tell you now his greatest plan

Invented when I cannot tell
Defied the thoughts of man so well
Man wants money for his need
But soon it sows its evil seed

Unhappiness it only brings
As man wants more and better things
If not enough the evil lies
But soon you'll find somebody dies
Throughout the years there have been wars
Power and richness have been the cause
Trapped in money's evil net
Man wants more than he can get

You don't need money
No, no, no, no
You don't need money
No, no, no, no
You don't need money

It'll never bring you love
No more than the sun above
You'll never see the end
The money you will surely spend

But ask for help if you sin
Reclaim yourself, what a state you're in
The devil has you in his grasp
There ain't no mercy you can ask

More and more you will need
You're strangled in the clutch of greed
You can't get out, no place to go
You sold your soul - the answer's no!Embed",0.237,0.652,0.111,-0.9904

Over which I had to peek through

The splendid things I planned
I always built, alas
On weak and shifting sand;
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away
* Yesterday, when I was young
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me, and nothing else at all
Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond;
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died;
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue

In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head

Take a walk with your favorite girl

With my suit buttoned tight, and my suedes on

To be willing to die so that honor and justice may live
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest

Beware, my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care, my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's so hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss
Your lips are much too close to mine
Beware, my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

He gives you beauty charm and grace
Then puts wrinkles in your face

But there's one thing he can't change

I want to be in the warm heart of your loving mind
To feel you all around me
And to take your hand along the sand

When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find
For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing
T'would make me sing
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near, to kill my fears
To help me to leave all my blues behind
Standing in your heart is where I want to be
And I long to be

Or the moments that you thought, where am I going

They reflect the things you've said
And the echoes in your head continue showing

Near the castles you can build
Out of dreams you half fulfilled
Won't keep out all of the ill wind that is blowing
And you look, still, for a trace
Of an opening in a place
Where you find the life that you were used to knowing
You can walk out in the night
And be sure that it's all right
To exaggerate the world that's only being
You can watch Regina dance
Through the crystal panes of glass
Yet you know that there's so much that she's not seeing

Still, you hold one precious thought
After all this time you've sought
That she might be just protecting what she longs for
And her eyes are veiled with black
'Cause she plays she can look back
At the love she wanted so but says is no more

The lights go on, commence the cold
As your senses will be sold
To the parrot watchers mimicking no reasons
To pretend that what they are
From the fact completely far
While the truth may be betrayal, lies and treason

Build their towers in the sand
Down the roads of their command
When the kingdom is the innocence they're stealing
And infection easily spreads
To the searching, twisted heads

Came a roar and a thunder men had never heard
Like the screamin' sound of a big war bird

A funny-lookin' dog with a big black nose
He flew into the sky to seek revenge
But the Baron shot him down (Curses, foiled again!)

The kind of a man the West would need to tame a troubled land

When it came to shootin' straight and fast, he was mighty good

Many a man would face his gun and many a man would fall

Just tryin' to build a peaceful land where love is free to grow

Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd return that fateful night, oh that night
When nothin' she said could keep her man from goin' out to fight
From the moment a girl gets to be full-grown, the very first thing she learns
When two men go out to face each other only one returns

Little to win, but nothin' to lose

Throw your pride to one side, it's the least you can do

John and Mitchy were gettin' kind of itchy
Just to leave their folk music behind;
Zal and Denny workin' for a penny
Tryin' to get a fish on the line
In a coffee house Sebastian sat
And after every number they'd pass the hat
McGuinn and McGuire just a-gettin' higher in L.A.,
You know where that's at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
Zal he said, ""Denny, you know there aren't many
Who can sing a song the way that you do; let's go south.""
Denny said, ""Zally, golly, don't you think that I wish
I could play guitar like you.""

And after every number they'd pass the hat
McGuinn and McGuire still a-gettin' higher in L.A.,
You know where that's at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
When Cass was a sophomore, planned to go to Swarthmore
But she changed her mind one day
Standin' on the turnpike, thumb out to hitchhike
""Take me to New York right away.""
When Denny met Cass he gave her love bumps;
Called John and Zal and that was the Mugwumps
McGuinn and McGuire couldn't get no higher
But that's what they were aimin' at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
Mugwumps, high jumps, low slumps, big bumps---
Don't you work as hard as you play
Make up, break up, everything is shake up;
Guess it had to be that way
Sebastian and Zal formed the Spoonful;
Michelle, John, and Denny gettin' very tuneful
McGuinn and McGuire just a-catchin' fire in L.A.,
You know where that's at
And everybody's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
Broke, busted, disgusted, agents can't be trusted
And Mitchy wants to go to the sea
Cass can't make it; she says we'll have to fake it---
We knew she'd come eventually

Tents low rent, but keeping out the heat's hard
Duffy's good vibrations and our imaginations
Can't go on indefinitely

Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold
Searching for the very souls

With a voice without restraint
“Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own
But go on your way accordingly
But know you’re not alone”

And I dreamed I was amongst the ones

Walk down your doorsteps, you'll take some more steps
What did you take them for?
There's a private in my boat and he wears
Pins instead of medals on his coat
There's a chicken in my nest and she won't
Lay until I've given her my best
At her request she asks for nothing
You get nothing in return
If you want she brings you water
If you don't then you will burn

You go through changes, it may seem strange
Is this what you're put here for?
You think you're happy and you are happy
That's what you're happy for
There's a man who can't decide if he should
Fight for what his father thinks is right
There are people wearing frowns who'll screw you up
But they would rather screw you down
At my request I ask for nothing
You get nothing in return
If you're nice she'll bring me water
If you're not then I will burn

And I'll face each day with a smile

This is the only thing that I am sure of
And that's all that lives is gonna die

And for every happy hello, there will be good-bye

There goes my only possesion there goes my everything

You've used it well but what the hell
That's what walls are for
I'm not ashamed
To listen to the fast-fallin' rain
In the morning upon my window
I'm not afraid to cry
I'm not ashamed to try
To be your friend once again
'Cause that's what's friends are for
Friends are for sorting out the hang-ups that we hide
Walls are for shutting out the love we feel inside

I'm not ashamed no to talk it over once again
To rearrange my vocabulary
But I can't seem to find
Any words to change your mind
Because I left them all behind
And that's what words are for

Words are for explaining the mistakes we might have made
Names are for calling when there's nothing left to say

I'm not ashamed, no, to say that I've loved you well
I'm not ashamed, and yet I know
I'm just a name, that's all
Scratched upon your wall
You've used it well, but what the hell

Chasing you around the back woods

Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Wanting their wedding day[x2]

So strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climed that wall
But I'm going to be the first
I'm going to be the first

I'd hate to see you fall
Because there is no doubt they'll carry you out

But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall

porter wagoner,words and music,1967,"Words and Music LyricsI was in a lonely cafe by the roadside all unfriendly people no one said a word
When in there stepped a starry eyed old stranger
He sat down threw up his arms and then I heard
Let me have about me lots of words and music
Gather round and tell me anything you know
Let's talk and sing and let's have words and music
Give me lots of words and music till I go

Then with spirits high and the conversation livens
The old man told us all where he'd come from
He said where I've been it's dark and lonely and you know I hardly ever see the sun
The kids all said the place would be best for me
And they took all the money they said to pay the bills
But you know I haven't heard a word from 'em and I sorta think I never will
And words're so important when you're lonely
And music has always been so good for me
So let's talk and sing and let's have words and music
Cause they'll come find me and they'll see that I got free
Then the old man's starry eyes grew cold and lifeless
When he saw the men in white suits standin' at the door
He turned and shouted please don't take me back there
And then he fell down to his knees upon the floor
Then stepping from a corner of the cafe a mask of teardrops streaming down his face
A young man came to claim his long lost daddy
And soon their happy voices filled the place
Let me have about me...
Give me lots of words and music till I goEmbed",0.046,0.879,0.075,0.932

With broken dreams and pieces of the

A world of warm words sparkling colors
That shone to keep us through days of wishing
And nights of coming true
Coming true

Pieces falling all around you

But hopelessness is not forgotten
Days of living and nights of dying

As she walks beside my easy chair

johnny cash,the flint arrowhead,1967,"The Flint Arrowhead Lyrics[Verse]
While traveling this land from border to border and from sea to sea
There have a few occasions to leave the beaten path and to find the place
And quiet that's good for thought and just walking through a trackless forest
Or exploring ruins of the earliest settlers or walking along a creek bed
Hoping to find a relic such as a tomahawk an axe
Or even an arrowhead left by a race of long since vanished Indians
There's a great thrill and it's a wonderful feeling to find a flint arrowhead
Over fields of new turned sod and in communion with my God I walked alone
In a furrow bed I found an arrowhead chiseled from stone
I don't know how long ago some redman drew his bow on its last fight
Or did he drop it here afraid white men were near to attack at night
I do know this one thing beyond all questioning it was made to kill
And proof of a master trade is in this arrowhead he made fashioned with skill
That I inherited this ground is denied by this stone I've found but when and by who
Come join me in my tracks then let's stop and look back to the vale and through
In love and peace we'll see the shadows and the trees and voices too
But quietly slowly tread this home of the forgotten dead whose bones are dust
I'm proud that their craftsmen's skill survives the ages still left in my trustEmbed",0.1,0.794,0.105,0.7615

And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines

Planted on their columns now that binds me

And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

Take Robin and Buddy Ellins

I dip my cup of soup back from the gurglin'
Cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can

Now I don't suppose those overalls did impress you a lot
Or that cold and useless arm the old man's got
That arm's gone because he jack-knifed a rig in thе fog

If someone needs help on the road, well, ole Sam's always ready
Oh, they don't need to be female waiting all smiles young and pretty

Well up to date seven of 'em's rolled him for every dime he had
You see there's more to drivin' a truck than gettin' from here to there

Green and bluffin' 'round against the sea
And there the sun came
And the rain pourin' down
Garden grew and flourished
And splattered bits of color on the ground
And it took shape and symmetry and all of life around
But there came winds, driven and howling
There came snow and I feared for the garden
So I built a wall and I built another
And roofed it over thick and strong
And kept it from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
The killing cold could not get in
But when the sun came
And the gentle rain of spring
They could not reach the garden behind those walls
It would have died
Safely, securely, died
But as I longed and as I learned
I tore the walls all down

And my feelings started to show

Only danced alone
The colors of my father's dreams
Faded without a sound

And I live in Paris now
My children dance and dream
Hearing the ways of a miner's life
In words they've never seen

Where the Black Angel did weep not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

And wandering's brother walked on through the night
With his hair in his face on a long splintered cut from the knife
Of GT
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long to his skull

Shining brightly red-rimmed and redlined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool, good buy

To the cozy brown snow of the east

Where you come from the stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame

And Rovermans' refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
With the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on
And if the stone glances off, split didactics in two
Leave the color of the mouse trails

harry nilsson,together,1968,"Together LyricsLife isn't easy
When two are divided
And one has decided to bring down the curtain
And one thing's for certain
There's nothing to keep them together

How does it happen
That two can be tender
And one be the lender
Of love and emotion
That covered the ocean
Of sadness that kept them together
Love when it started
Was easy to measure
Each day was a pleasure
Each night an adventure
Each morning was something
That had to be shared together

Love when it's growing
Is full of surprises
Its temperature rises
From higher to higher
Then turns into fire
That has to be shared together

Then came the sadness
Which follows the laughter
Which, shortly thereafter
The dream had exploded
The promise was broken
Now few words are spoken together

Life isn't easy
When two are divided
And one has decided to bring down the curtain
And one thing's for certain
There's nothing to keep them togetherEmbed",0.082,0.707,0.211,0.9735
harry nilsson,daddy's song,1968,"Daddy’s Song LyricsYears ago, we knew a man
He was my mother's biggest fan
We used to walk beside the sea
And he told me how life would be
When I grew up to be a man

And years ago, we used to play
He used to laugh when I ran away
And if I fell and hurt my knee
He would run to comfort me
And the pain would go away
Years ago, we knew a boy
He was his daddy's pride and joy (pride and joy!)
And then his daddy would run away
It was such a rainy day
That he brought out all his toys

And how the mother did explain
Trying to take away the pain
But he just couldn't understand
That his father was not a man
And it all was just a game

The years have passed and so have I
Making it hard for me to cry
And if and when I have a son
Let it all be said and done
Let the sadness pass him byEmbed",0.091,0.828,0.081,-0.6049

I hired a coach to take me from confusion to the plane
And though we shared a common space I know I'll never meet again
The driver with his eyebrows furrowed in the rear-view mirror
I read his name and it was plainly written Nathan La Franeer

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I asked him would he hurry
But we crawled the canyons slowly
Through the buyers and the sellers
Through the burglar bells and the wishing wells

With gangs and girly shows

The cars and buses bustled through the bedlam of the day
I looked through window glass at streets and Nathan grumbled at the grey
I saw an aging cripple selling Superman balloons
The city grated through chrome-plate, the clock struck slowly half-past-noon

Through the tunnel tiled and turning
Into daylight once again I am escaping
Once again goodbye
To symphonies and dirty trees

He hated everyone who paid to ride and share his common space

And slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

The photograph album she takes from the closet and slowly turns the first page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age
She closes her eyes and touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for that moment she's wearing the gown

That it's causing me to swoon

When you go out in the street
So many hassles with the heat;
No one there can fill your desire
Cops out with the megaphones
Telling people stay inside their home
Man, can't they see the world's on fire?

Sharing a love I thought would last forever
Moonlight to show the way so we can follow
Waiting inside her eyes was my tomorrow
Then something changed her mind, her kisses told me
I had no loving arms to hold me

Every day I wake up then I start to break up
Lonely is a man without love
Every day I start out then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love
Every day I wake up then I start to break up
Knowing that it's cloudy above
Every day I start out then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love
I cannot face this world that's fallen down on me
So if you see my girl please send her home to me
Tell her about my heart that's slowly dying
Say I can't stop myself from crying

All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the nights were long
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song
If you go away if you go away if you go away
But if you'll stay I'll make you a day like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun we'll glide on the rain we'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go I'll understand leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away if you go away if you go away
If you go away as I know you will you must tell the world to stop turning
Till you return again if you ever do for what good is love without loving you
Can I tell you now as you turn to go I'll be dying slow to the next hello
If you go away if you go away if you go away
If you go away as I know you might there'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space like the empty look I see on your face
I have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away if you go away if you go away
But if you'll stay I'll make you a night like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile I'll glide on your touch I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go I know I will cry and all the good is gone from the words goodbye

Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass, I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me?

I saw your face and heard you call my name

And not a man could get inside, no way could be found
It was here for thousands of years before our life began
Waiting very patiently for evolving man
When the galaxy was young they looked upon the earth
And saw that its position was promising for birth
They searched for life but finding none they left a beacon bright
Its signal had not been disturbed in the eternal light

And I can only watch the sickened sorrow

Of the progressions that you teach
The people that you reach are tired
Of livin' in a world of elastic towers

And talk with them of life and all its dangers

Oblivious to the night, the fog around you
The germs they are rediculous
They bother you at night
The blood that rushes to your brain
The ticket on the plane you're never catching
The price you pay exclusive of your taxes
To chop you up inside with tiny axes
The girl looks up to you from floors she waxes
And speaks to your belt with tears among her eyes

And the clock on the wall is a bore

But only those that know you don't ignore you

And caught you lying on the couch with father time
And the clock on the wall is a bore

Fields of corn on early summer mornings

Where life seemed not so soon
Now all too soon

There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, and they all did agree
That the man who ran looked a lot like me

The judge said ""Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word, although it meant my life
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave where the night winds wail
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
The scaffold was high and eternity neared
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave where the night winds wail
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees
Nobody knows but meEmbed",0.072,0.869,0.059,-0.668

By forgotten words and boons
And the ink stains
That have dried upon some line

Keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted
On their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman is crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy, might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you
Walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurgling
Crackling caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands round a tin
Can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads

Changing your mind as you go through time

With tired eyes you follow the man
That has in his hand a banner that says 'dust to dust'

willie nelson,travis letter,1968,"Travis Letter LyricsCommandancy of the Alamo San Antonio, February 24th 1836

To the people of Texas and all the Americans in the world, fellow citizens and compatriots. I am besieged with a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna and I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for twenty-four hours and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender of discretion
Otherwise the garrison are to be put to the sword if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with a cannon shot and our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then I call on you in the name of liberty and of patriotism and of everything dear to the American character to come to our aide with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected I am determined to sustain as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due his own honor and that of his country.​ Victory or Death!

William Barrett Travis, Lieutenant Colonel, Commandant

P.S.​ The Lord is on our side. When the enemy appeared in sight we had not three bushels of corn. We have since found in deserted houses eighty or ninety bushels and got into the walls twenty or thirty head of beeves.​

jerry jeff walker,little bird,1968,"Little Bird [1968] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Little bird come and sat upon my window sill
Sat there thru the fallin' rain
As I watched that little bird upon my window sill
Saw my thoughts of you go by again

[Chorus]
And a picture of my face
Reflected on the pane
Is it tears I see or is it rain?
[Verse 2]
I remember how we talked before we said goodbye
Too young to notice this world outside our door
And now the miles of time have built a wall of love
Though I try I just can't tear it down

[Verse 3]
For I said that love takes many shapes, it has no form
Has no boundaries, has not grips to hold
But time will take the foolish hand [?] pain
Make the heart look back with eyes grown cold

[Chorus]
And the picture of my face
Reflected on the pane
Is it tears I see or is it rain?

[Verse 4]
I've no regrets about the past, there's nothing I can change
Life's a road you walk just one way down
Looking back, I do recall that frame of time
When the world was love and time was just a thought

[Verse 5]
Many things go many ways, your course of life is such
We almost picked that road of life to walk
And age gives off old memories like handnotes [in love?]
Where the world is time and that love is just a thought
[Chorus]
And the picture of my face
Reflected on the pane
Is it tears I see or is it rain?

[Verse 6]
As my thoughts go tumblin' back I wonder how you look
I wonder if you've seen that little bird
I wonder if he's sat upon your window sill
I wonder if you'll ever hear these words

jerry jeff walker,my old man,1968,"My Old Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
My old man had a rounder soul
He'd hear an old freight train and then he'd have to go
He said he'd been blessed with a gypsy bone
And that's the reason I guess that he'd been cursed to roam
He came through town back before the war
Didn't even know what it was that he was lookin' for
He carried a tattered bag for his violin
Full of lots of songs of the places he had been
He talked real easy and he smiled and waved
He could pass along to you when his fiddle played
Makin' people drop their cares and woes
To hum out loud those tunes that his fiddle bowed
'Til the people there began to join that sound
And everyone in town was laughin,' singin,' dancin' 'round
The Fiddler's tunes were all they heard that night
Like some dream that says all the world is right
[Verse 2]
The Fiddler's eye caught one beauty there
She had that rollin' flowin' golden kind of hair
He played for her as if she danced alone
He played his favorite songs, the ones he called his own
'Til she alone was dancin' in the room
The only thing left movin' to that Fiddler's tune

[Verse 3]
He played until she was the last to go
Then he stopped and packed his case, said he'd take her home
In all the nights that passed a child was born
In all the years that passed, love would keep them warm
And all their lives they'd share that dream come true
All because she danced so well his fiddler tune

[Verse 4]
The train next mornin' blew a lonesome sound
As if she sang the blues of what she took from town
And all that I recall that was said when I was young
Was no one else could really sing those songs he sungEmbed",0.054,0.803,0.144,0.9845

Bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe
Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away
They both robbed and killed until both of them died
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde

The poems that she wrote of the life that they led
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game
The rampage grew wilder with each passing day
The odds growing smaller with each getaway
With the end growing closer the harder they fought
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught

They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dying, they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde

Two years of running was ended that day
For robbing and killing, they both had to pay
But we'll always remember how they lived and died

Of the rubbish that had gathered in god's name

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Down, down, down

[Verse 1]
Well I asked my friend, ""Where is that black smoke coming from?""
He just coughed and changed the subject and said, ""Oh, I think it might snow some""
So I left him sipping his tea and I jumped in my chariot
And rode off to see just why and who could it be this time
Sisters and brothers, daddies, mothers standing around crying
When I reached the scene the flames were making a ghostly whine
So I stood on my horse's back and I screamed without a crack
I say, ""Oh baby why'd you burn your brother's house down?""
[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red, Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red, Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down
Down, down, down

[Verse 2]
Well, someone stepped from the crowd, he was nineteen miles high
He shouts we're tired and disgusted, so we paint red through the sky
I said the truth is straight ahead so don't burn yourself instead
Try to learn instead of burn, hear what I say, yeah, yeah
So I finally rode away but I'll never forget that day
Because when I reached the valley I looked way down cross the way
A giant boat from space landed with eerie grace
And came and taken all the dead away

[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey

Pats the head of another curly haired boy, just another toy
Sick with silence, she weeps sincerely
Saying words that have oh so clearly been said

Life has made her that much bolder now

Hair today now dipped in the water
Making love to every poor daughter's son
Isn't it fun?

Now, today, propping grace with envy
Lady Godiva peers to see if anyone's there
And hasn't a care
Doctor is coming the nurse thinks sweetly!
Turning on the machines that neatly pump air!
The body lies bare
Shaved and hairless what once was screaming!
Now lies silent and almost sleeping
The brain must have gone away
Strapped securely to the white table
Ether caused the body to wither and writhe
Underneath the white light
Doctor arrives with knife and baggage
Sees the growth as just so much cabbage
That must now be cut away
Now come the moment of Great! Great! Decision!
The doctor is making his first incision

""The ether tube's leaking,"" says someone who's sloppy

And here did lie on the ground-o

And talks to the night and the day-o

Oh, it's fading away from me, yeah
'Cause your touch, your touch has grown cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
I can feel the presence of another woman

It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Oh baby, I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's everywhere
Oh baby, baby, I'm losing you
When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
I'm hurt, downhearted and worried, boy
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me

Oh, it's all over your face
Someone's taken my place
Oh, I'm losing you
You try hard to hide
That emptiness inside

Blues that keeps on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free

Memories, time cannot erase
And I awake and find you gone
And I'm so blue and all alone
So far away from you, so sweet and warm

scott walker,if you go away,1969,"If You Go Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you go away, on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
And the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song

[Refrain]
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away
[Chorus]
But, if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
And talk to the trees, and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand

[Refrain]
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

[Verse 2]
If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning, turning
'Til you return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you?
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly, till the next hello

[Refrain]
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

[Chorus]
But, if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll glide on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But, if you go, I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
[Refrain]
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

[Verse 3]
If you go away, as I know you must
There'd be nothing left in this world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
And I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If you might have kept me by your side

None of the worries we'll live for the call
Of our hearts made of iron or of stone

Come a stark naked drummer
A-beating the drum
With his hands on his bosom come marching along
Sat down on a hard, hard cold frozen stone
Ten thousand stood around me
Yet I was alone
Took my hat in my hands
For to keep my head warm
Ten thousand got drownded that never was born

scott walker,the seventh seal,1969,"The Seventh Seal Lyrics[Verse 1]
Anybody seen a knight pass this way?
I saw him playing chess with Death, yesterday
His crusade was a search for God and they say
It's been a long way to carry on

[Verse 2]
Anybody hear of plague in this town?
The town I've left behind was burned to the ground
A young girl on a stake, her face framed in flames
Cried, ""I'm not a witch, God knows my name""
The knight, he watched with fear, he needed to know
He ran where he might feel God's breath
And in the misty church, he knelt to confess
The face within the booth was Mr. Death
[Verse 3]
""My life's a vain pursuit of meaningless miles...
Why can't God touch me with a sign?""
""Perhaps there's no one there,"" answered the booth
And Death hid within his cloak and smiled
""This morning I played chess with Death,"" said the knight
""We played that he might grant me time...
My bishop and my knight will shatter his flanks
And still I might feel God's heart in mine!""

[Verse 4]
And through confession's grille, Death's laughter was heard
The knight cried, ""No, you've cheated me!
But still I'll find a way, we'll meet once again
And once again continue to play!""
They met within the woods, the knight, his squire, and friends
And Death said, ""Now, the game shall end""
The final move was made, the knight hung his head
And said, ""You've won, I've nothing left to play...""

[Verse 5]
The minstrel filled with visions, sang to his love
To look against the stormy sky
The knight, his squire, and friends, their hands held as one
Solemnly danced toward the dawn
His hourglass in his hand, his scythe by his side
The master, Death, he leads them on
The rain will wash away the tears from their faces
And as the thunder cracked, they were gone5Embed",0.111,0.759,0.13,0.9063

Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown and

Three hours from sundown
Jeremy flies
Hoping to keep
The sun from his eyes
East from the city
And down to the cave
In search of a master
In search of a slave

Three hours from London
Giacomo's free
Taking his woes
Down to the sea
In search of a lifetime
To tell when he's home
In search of a story
That's never been known
[Verse 3]
Three hours from speaking
Everyone's flown
Not wanting to be
Seen on their own
Three hours is needed
To leave from them all
Three hours to wonder
And three hours to fall

To be with the one you love

leonard cohen,story of isaac,1969,"Story of Isaac LyricsThe door it opened slowly
My father he came in, I was nine years old
And he stood so tall above me
Blue eyes they were shining
And his voice was very cold
Said, ""I've had a vision
And you know I'm strong and holy
I must do what I've been told.""
So he started up the mountain
I was running, he was walking
And his ax was made of gold
Well, the trees they got much smaller
The lake a lady's mirror
We stopped to drink some wine
Then he threw the bottle over
Broke a minute later
And he put his hand on mine
Thought I saw an eagle
But it might have been a vulture
I never could decide
Then my father built an altar
He looked once behind his shoulder
He knew I would not hide

You who build the altars now
To sacrifice these children
You must not do it anymore
A scheme is not a vision
And you never have been tempted
By a demon or a god
You who stand above them now
Your hatchets blunt and bloody
You were not there before
When I lay upon a mountain
And my father's hand was trembling
With the beauty of the word
And if you call me brother now
Forgive me if I inquire
""Just according to whose plan?""

And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playin' on the horses, you were playin' on the guitar strings
You were playin' like a devil wearin' wings

[Chorus 1]
Wearin' wings, you looked so grand wearin' wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing?
Can you fly? I heard you can, can you fly?
Like an eagle doin' your huntin' from the sky
[Verse 2]
I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice
And I thought I saw you cheatin' once or twice

[Chorus 2]
Once or twice, I heard your bid once or twice
Were you wond'rin' was the gamble worth the price?
Pack it in, I heard you did, pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win?

[Verse 3]
So lately you've been hidin', it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
And a voice calls out the numbers and it sometimes mentions mine
And I feel like I've been workin' overtime

[Chorus 3]
Over time, I've lost my fire over time
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Slowin' down, I'm gettin' tired, slowin' down
And I envy you the valley that you've found

[Outro]
Cause I'm midway down the midway
Slowin' down
Down, down, downEmbed",0.057,0.832,0.111,0.9525

And a wish is just a dream
You wish to come true, woo woo

If only I could have a puppy
I'd call myself so very lucky
Just to have some company
To share a cup of tea with me

I'd take my puppy everywhere
La, la, la-la I wouldn't care
And we would stay away from crowds
And signs that said no dogs allowed
Oh we, I know he'd never bite me
Whoa de lo.......
We, I know he'd never bite me
If only I could have a friend
To stick with me until the end
And walk along beside the sea
Share a bit of moon with me

I'd take my friend most everywhere
La, la, la-la I wouldn't care
We would stay away from crowds
With signs that said no friends allowed
Oh we, we'd be so happy to be

And who can make one seed then make it grow

With one I'll remain, ah that's how my old heartaches start
You know ones got brown eyes, and the other's eyes are blue
To one I am tied, to the other I guess I'll have to be true""

And I meet lots of friendly people

Because I got nobody waiting for me anywhere
Home is anywhere I'm living
If it's sleeping on some vacant bench in city squares
Or if I'm working on some road gang

Beneath the haloed moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game

steve young,rock salt and nails,1969,"Rock Salt And Nails LyricsBy the banks of the river where the willows grow old
And the wild birds warble the strange-soundin' song
By the banks of the river where the waters run cold
Was there I first listened to the lies that you told

Now I lay here each night all alone and I weep
And nothin' ain't worse than a night without sleep
The letters you wrote me they're written in shame
But I know that your conscience still echoes my name

Now if the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies were thrushes
I'd lay for hours in the cold rainy marshes
If the ladies were squirrels with big bushy tails
I'd fill up my shotgun with a rock salt and nails

jerry jeff walker,driftin' way of life,1969,"Driftin’ Way of Life LyricsI'm singing about a driftin' way of life
Yes it's different from the many that I've known
Yeah and everyday you're bound to walk
A strange new road by myself
I keep living it right or wrong

Now I hop a train about a 100 thousand miles
Yeah and I've had good luck
And I've lived in different styles
Yeah but all the folks
No matter what place or age
Have tried to put me like a free bird in a cage
Well I keep singing about a driftin' way of life

Now I've tied some knots
With my friends I'd hate to lose
I say we're friends because we give the right to choose
But things get tight when your friends get out of place
And try to change your big hat
Or shape of face

So I keep singing about the driftin' way of life

Now in my mind
You know I thought of settling down
To stop my roaming
Forget this banging around
But to live my life among groups everyday
Will either change me
Or send me down the way
And as it stands I'm never down-and-out too long
'Cause I can kiss the blues goodbye with every song
Yeah and I'm living my life
As it feels to me right now (walk on boy)
'Cause there ain't nothing in this world
Gonna hold me down

james gang,collage,1969,"Collage LyricsBlue for the blue I feel when I'm feelin down on the ground
Feelin' down
That could be most any day
Green for the eyes, take look around
When the sun goes down and the sun goes down
In the strangest way
Red for the light, got to stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything
That I meant to say
Meant to say
Three for the mice that are blind like the world
Never see the good that is done, just the bad
It's too late to see
Two of us make it easier to read the signs
Memorize the lines
Will you play with me?
One for the road, I'll be on my way
Come another day, when the things we say
Find a way to be
Way to be

Autumn calls for a change of year, bringing winter near us
Green to brown and the sky's a sign

And thought exactly the same as I'm thinking now
Every night for a year I've slept alone
My cold, damp room looks worse than me
I got a fear of death that creeps on every night
I know I won't die soon but then again I might
Just like water down the drain, I'm wasting away
And oh, doctors can't help, a ghost of a man, that's me

Hard to find new words to say
I think about the bad old days

Nights of winter turn me cold
Fears of dying, getting old
We ran the race, the race was won
By running slowly
Could be soon we'll cease to sound
Slowly upstairs, faster down
Then to revisit stony grounds
We used to know
Remembering mornings, shillings spent
Made no sense to leave the bed
The bad old days, they came and went
Giving way to fruitful years
[Guitar solo]
Saving up the birds in hand
While in the bush the others land
Take what we can before the man
Says it's time to go

Each to his own way, I'll go mine
